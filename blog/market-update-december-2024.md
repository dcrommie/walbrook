## Market Key Points

* The Australian equity market rebounded in 
October returning 3.8% over the month. 
* Global developed markets had a strong month, 
US equity markets buoyed by the presidential 
election results.
* Asian markets suffered most visibly by 
comparison as the threat of tariffs potentially 
imposed by a Trump presidency were assessed.

### Australian equities

After losing ground in October, the ASX 200 rebounded 
strongly in November, posting its best returns since 
July. The ASX 200 Accumulation Index rose by 3.8% for 
the month. This performance was largely driven by the 
clarity provided to Australian investors following the 
US election.

Out of the 11 sectors, nine recorded gains. Information 
Technology led the way with a 10.5% increase, followed 
by Utilities (+9.1%), Financials ex-Property (+7.0%), and 
Consumer Discretionary (+6.9%). However, Energy (-
0.7%) and Materials (-2.6%) lagged.

Information Technology continued its impressive 
momentum, returning 68.3% over the past 12 months. 
Standout stocks for the month included TechnologyOne 
(ASX: TNE), Xero (ASX: XRO), and Life360 (ASX: 360).

In contrast, investors were cautious in the Energy and 
Materials sectors due to concerns over additional US 
tariffs impacting the already stuttering Chinese 
economy. Major players like Rio Tinto (ASX: RIO), BHP 
(ASX: BHP), and Fortescue (ASX: FMG) saw declines. 

Gold miners also struggled as investors rushed to the 
US Dollar following the Trump election, which pushed 
down the price of gold.

### Global Equities

Developed Markets outperformed Emerging markets in 
November largely driven by a rally in US Markets, post election results. Developed markets gained 5.18% (MSCI 
World Ex-Australia Index (AUD)) versus a -3.07% 
return (MSCI Emerging Markets Index (AUD)).

US markets rallied post-election results with the S&P500 
closing at an all-time high, gaining 8.8% for the month 
(in local currency terms). The FOMC decision to cut 
interest rates by another 25 basis points also contributed 
to a broad market rally with the Nasdaq Composite 
gaining 6.3% (in local currency terms) while the Russell 
2000 gained 11.0%, the best month since December 2023. 

Asian markets suffered most visibly in November as 
Trump threatened to impose Tariffs when in office. The 
Chinese Hang Seng Index fell -4.23%, while the CSI 300 
Index, rose a modest 0.75% (in local currency terms), 
assisted by further Chinese pledges from authorities to 
support the economy. while in Japan the Nikkei 225 
Index fell -2.22% (in local currency terms).


### Property

The S&P/ASX 200 A-REIT Accumulation Index TR 
reversed the negative result in October, finishing the 
month up 2.48% in November. The Index is up 26.0% 
YTD. 

Similarly, global real estate equities also reverted, 
increasing by 2.7% (represented by the FTSE 
EPRA/NAREIT Developed Ex Australia Index (AUD 
Hedged)). Australian infrastructure saw the largest 
reversal of the three indexes, bouncing back with a 
return of 4.98% after a falling 4.75% in October. The 
index has delivered a return of 9.65% YTD. 

November saw muted activity in Australia on the M&A 
front across the A-REIT sector, with AGM season 
dominating company announcements. Tense talks 
continued between Hotel Property Investments (HPI) 
and the Charter Hall Retail REIT (CQR) led consortium. 
Following the rejected revised bid of $3.85-per-share, 
the bid was lowered to $3.785-per-share.

As expected, 
HPI directors have unanimously recommended 
shareholders reject the offer. Stockland Corporation 
Limited (SGP) acquired 12 Australian residential 
master-planned communities from Lendlease (LLC) for 
$1.06bn.

The transfer of projects was completed on 29 
November. Dexus (DXS) has announced it has entered 
into an agreement to sell two office properties (Pyrmont, 
Sydney and Brisbane) for $443.2m.

The Australian residential property market experienced 
an increase of +0.1% Month on Month (as represented 
by CoreLogic’s five capital city aggregate). Perth 
continued its strong run and was the biggest riser 
(+1.1%, 21.0% YoY), followed by Adelaide (+0.8%) and 
Brisbane (+0.6%). In contrast, Melbourne was the worst 
performer and continued to experience a fall in value (-
0.4%) alongside Hobart (-0.1%) and Sydney (-0.2%).

### Fixed Income

The bond market displayed mixed signals throughout 
November. Early in the month, investors anticipated 
volatility and potential inflationary pressures following 
a Trump victory in the US elections. However, as 
uncertainty subsided, yields began to fall, and the 
month concluded on a more favourable outlook.

While the overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed 
signs of easing, the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) 
preferred measure, core inflation, rose month-on-month 
indicating a sticky inflationary environment.

This suggests that the RBA is unlikely to cut rates until 
the new year. In addition, the labour market showed 
signs of cooling, with wage growth decelerating and 
consumer confidence stabilising however, broader 
economic uncertainty remains. Amidst this backdrop, 
the 2-year and 10-year yields Australian government 
bond yields dropped 8 and 16 basis points respectively.

In the US, the Federal Reserve implemented a 25-basis 
point rate cut, in line with a softening job market and 
bringing inflation closer to the 2% goal. As the month 
unfolded, the bond market started to correct its initial 
overreaction to the potential inflationary policies under 
the newly elected administration, with yields on the 2-
year and 10-year US government bonds falling by 3 and 
12 basis points, respectively.

### Currencies

The Australian dollar (AUD) maintained its value over 
the month of November, closing flat at 0.0% in trade 
weighted terms at 61.5, depreciating against the US 
Dollar (USD) and the Japanese Yen (JPY), whilst 
appreciating against the Pound Sterling (GBP) and Euro 
(EUR).

The Australian dollar weakened against the USD in 
November, amid speculation around the upcoming 
Trump administration’s policy implementations.

Additionally, the Federal Reserve cut its interest rates 
by 25bps in November with the RBA maintaining rates 
for the month. Across European markets the AUD 
appreciated, with investors seeing Europe as more 
sensitive to trade wars with potential tariffs.

Relative to the AUD, the JPY appreciated the most in 
November, appreciating by 2.4%. Conversely, the GBP 
was the lowest performer of the month, depreciating in 
relative terms by 0.1% against the AUD. Year-on-year, 
the AUD remains ahead of the EUR by 1.6%, whilst the 
USD, GBP and JPY are ahead by 1.4%, 2.3% and 0.4% 
respectively in relative terms

## Economic key points

* Australian GDP for Q3 2024 was 0.3%, while the 
annual rate of 0.8% was the weakest in decades.
* The RAB kept interest rates at 4.35% during its 
November meeting. 
* The FED cut interest rates to 4.75% in its November 
meeting

### Australia

GDP growth for the September quarter slowed further 
to +0.8% on an annual basis, well below economists’ 
expectations. This was despite rising federal and state 
government spending, which ABS data indicates 
jumped 4.7% compared to the previous September 
quarter.

The RBA recently admitted that it had 
underestimated the scale of aggregate fiscal spending, 
including infrastructure programs, public servant wage 
inflation and the burgeoning cost of the NDIS.
 
The weaker GDP data has revived expectations for our 
central bank to cut interest rates in the first half of 2025.
The RBA kept rates at 4.35% at the November meeting 
with minutes from the meeting showed that the board 
members had considered a range of scenarios which 
might justify an easing of monetary policy.
 
However, the commentary also suggested a reluctance to move 
towards rate cuts without sustained or widespread 
indications that they were required, for example in 
needing to observe “more than one good quarterly 
inflation outcome” to be confident that any decline was 
sustainable.

CPI data showed the headline inflation rate to be 
unchanged at +2.1% for the rolling 12 months to 
October, but the trimmed mean metric favoured by the 
RBA accelerated from +3.2% to +3.5% for the same 
period. The change reflected broad-based price 
pressures across a range of goods and services, belying 
the headline numbers which have been skewed down 
by federal and state government energy rebates.

The unemployment rate was steady at 4.1% in October, 
matching market estimates.
Retail sales rose 0.6% in October, ahead of market 
expectations of a 0.3% increase, while annual sales
jumped 3.4% for the same period. The Westpac Melbourne Institute Consumer Sentiment Index
increased 5.3% to 94.6 in November as consumers see
some further easing in the pressure on family finances, 
are no longer concerned about the risk of further interest 
rate rises and are becoming more confident about the 
economic outlook.

Composite PMI was steady at 50.2 in November, just 
into expansion territory and driven by services activity.
The trade surplus widened to $5.93bn in October, the 
largest since February, ahead of market estimates of 
$4.55 billion and the revised prior reading of $4.53 
billion.

### US

The US elections gave a clear mandate to Donald Trump 
and the Republican party with President-elect Trump 
winning 5 of the 7 key battleground states and the 
Republican party gaining majorities in both houses of 
Congress. This control of the US Congress has 
improved the prospects that the party can deliver their 
policy agenda, including tighter border security, tax and 
spending cuts, and deregulation.

Non-farm payroll added 227,000 jobs in November, 
ahead of market estimates of 200,000 and the revised 
36,000 recorded in the prior month. The unemployment 
rate was in line with market forecasts at 4.2%, a rise 
from the 4.1% last month. 

Retail sales in October rose 0.4%, above the anticipated 
0.3% but below the upwardly revised 0.8% increase seen 
in September. Annual retail sales increased 2.8%, ahead 
of the forecast 1.9%. Consumer sentiment rose to 71.8 in 
November, below the anticipated 73.7, but still the 
highest reading in seven months, with optimism about 
future employment prospects and the lowest inflation 
expectations since 2020.

Composite PMI rose to a 31-month high of 54.9 in 
November, driven by robust growth in services activity. 
The trade deficit narrowed in October to $73.8bn,
compared to a forecast $75bn deficit.

### Eurozone

GDP grew 0.4% in the September quarter, matching 
forecasts and up from 0.2% the previous quarter. Year 
on year GDP for the same period came in at 0.9%, up 
from 0.5% in the June quarter.

Annual inflation rose to 2.3% in November, matching 
market expectations. This increase was largely expected, 
as last year’s sharp declines in energy prices are no 
longer factored into annual rates.

Retail sales fell 0.5% in October, below the expected 
0.3% decline and reversing the 0.5% rise in September. 
Annual sales rose 1.9%, ahead of an anticipated 1.7%
rise. In November, consumer confidence dropped 1.2 
points to -13.7, well below the forecast -12.4. due to 
consumers’ substantially deteriorating assessments of 
both the economy and household’s future finances.

The unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.3% for
October, in line with market forecasts.

The Composite PMI dropped to 48.3 in November, with 
services activity declining for the first time in ten 
months and the manufacturing continuing its decline.

### UK

At its November meeting, the Bank of England cut 
interest rates for the second time this year, bringing 
them to 4.75%. 

This decision aligns with evidence of slowing price 
growth in the UK economy, with September’s inflation 
print dropping to a three-year low of 1.7%.
Annual inflation increased to 2.3% in October, 
exceeding both the Bank of England target range and 
market expectations of 2.2%. The largest upward 
contribution came from electricity and gas, reflecting the 
increase of the Ofgem energy price cap in October.

The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% for the three 
months to September, above the market estimates of 
4.1%.

Consumer confidence increased 3 points to -18 in 
November amid lower interest rates, rising wages and 
reduced concerns about tax increases. 

Composite PMI fell to 50.5 in November, with softer 
services growth unable to offset the renewed downturn 
in manufacturing activity.

### China

Annual inflation edged lower to 0.2% in November,
below the expected 0.5% and highlighting mounting
deflation risks despite recent stimulus measures from
the government and supportive monetary policy by the
central bank.

The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 51.5
in November, indicating factory activity expanding at
the fastest pace since June this year.

New export orders rose for the first time in four months, and business
confidence has also improved. This was consistent with
the broader Chinese Bureau of Statistics PMI (which
includes more state-owned companies), suggesting that
recent government stimulus is assisting local industry.
China’s unemployment rate fell to 5.0% in October,
below expectations of 5.1%.

Retail sales grew 4.8% year on year in October, easily 
beating market expectations of +3.8%. It was the fastest 
growth in retail turnover since February, boosted by a 
week-long holiday, a recent shopping festival, and a 
series of support measures from Beijing in late 
September to bolster demand.

### Japan

Bank of Japan Governor Ueda noted that the local 
economy was progressing towards sustainable wage driven inflation, which left the door open to a further 
interest rate hike in December. Although many 
uncertainties remained, Mr Ueda stated that full 
clarification of these wouldn’t necessarily be needed 
before taking further action. In mid December, the 
central bank is due to release its review on the 
unconventional monetary policies pursued since the late 
1990s.

Findings are expected to provide extra justification for 
the current plans to steadily raise interest rates towards 
more normal levels.

Annual inflation rate decreased to 2.3% in October as 
the effect of the energy subsidy removal in May 
diminished. 

Retail sales increased 0.1% in October with the annual 
rate rising 1.6% missing the forecast 2.2% increase
Consumer confidence came in at 36.4 in November, up 
from October’s five month low and in line with 
forecasts. 

Composite PMI bounced back into expansion territory, 
coming in at 50.1 in November and indicating a broad 
stabilization in private sector activity. While the service 
economy saw marginal growth, manufacturing 
production continued to decline, and new order 
stabilisation was driven by services output.
