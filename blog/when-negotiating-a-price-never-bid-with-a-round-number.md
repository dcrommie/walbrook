Here’s an easy tip for anyone negotiating to buy a car, a house, or even a company. When you make an initial offer, don’t bid with a round number like $10,000 or $1 million or $15 per share. Rather, bid with a more precise number, like $9,800 or $1.03 million or $14.80 per share.

According to a recent study of mergers and acquisitions, investors who offer “precise” bids for company shares yield better market outcomes than those who offer round-numbered bids.

“If one party gives a round number, it gives the signal that the party doesn't really know what it's doing"

“It turns out that if you make a precise bid, the targets are more likely to accept it, and more likely to accept it at a cheaper price. And with cash bids, they’ll generate a more positive market reaction,” says Matti Keloharju, a visiting scholar at Harvard Business School and co-author, with Petri Hukkanen, of the paper [Initial Offer Precision and M&A Outcomes (pdf)](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/16-058_27d73983-3441-4628-906c-10ce5fb7ac47.pdf).
