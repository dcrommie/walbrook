##Market Key Points

* During September, the Australian equity market declined by 2.8%. Most sectors finished the month lower, with the exception of Energy (+1.6%). Property (-8.6%), Information Technology (-7.9%) and Health Care (-6.2%) had the largest declines. 

* Overseas markets declined, except for the FTSE 100 Index (GBP), which finished 2.4% higher. While acknowledging recent volatility, most global equity markets have generated solid returns over the past twelve months. 

###Australian equities

The ASX 200 finished September down 2.8%, reflecting but outperforming the losses seen in global markets. Energy was the only gainer (1.6%), with all the other ten sectors finishing the month in the red. The largest drops were in Real Estate (-8.6%), Information Technology (-7.9%), and Healthcare (-6.2%).

Energy was the lone bright spot in the market, returning 1.6%, riding the tailwinds of rising global oil prices. In terms of the laggards, the Real Estate sector was hit hard with an 8.6% drop, reflecting the "higher-for-longer" rhetoric regarding interest rates and the potential 
impact on property values.

Given the potential impact of interest rates on high-growth tech stocks, IT was another sector seemingly hampered by the hawkish sentiment in September, suffering losses of 7.9% and mirroring the sell-off in US tech giants such as Apple, Nvidia, and Amazon.

###Global Equities

Global equities had a negative month, with September typically being the worst-performing month historically for stocks. Emerging markets outperformed developed market counterparts, returning -2.3% (MSCI Emerging Markets Index (AUD)) versus a -4.0% return according to the MSCI World Ex-Australia Index (AUD).

Continued negative economic data in September saw another rise in bond yields and a decrease in equity markets, with inflation falling slower than expected, primarily due to rising energy costs. US equities stumbled amid an interest rate hold and the prolonged possibility of a government shutdown, recording one of its worst months for the year, with the S&P500 Index  declining -4.8% (in local currency terms) during the 
month.

The UK was among the few positive performers for the month, with the FTSE 100 Index returning a gain of 2.4% (in local currency terms). A decrease in domestic core inflation and surprising GDP data above expectations drove the return. The Bank of England also kept interest rates on hold.

###Property

The S&P/ASX 200 A-REIT Accumulation index finished September lower after consecutive positive months in July and August, with the index finishing the month -8.6%. Global real estate equities (represented by the FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Ex Australia Index (AUD Hedged)) also fell, returning –5.3% for the month. Australian infrastructure finished lower through September, with the S&P/ASX Infrastructure Index TR returning -1.6% for the month.

The Australian residential property market experienced an increase of +0.9% Month on Month (as represented by CoreLogic's five capital city aggregate). Adelaide was the biggest riser (+1.7%), followed by Brisbane and Perth (both +1.3%). All five capital cities performed positively for the fifth consecutive month, with Melbourne (+0.4%) being the worst-performing city. Over the last twelve months, Perth was the largest gainer (+8.8%).

###Fixed Income

In his final meeting as RBA Governor, Phillip Lowe kept the cash rate on hold at 4.10% for the third month. During his term, Lowe and the RBA board cut rates to a historic 0.1 per cent and subsequently hiked rates 12 times in a bid to control inflation. Lowe's successor, Michele Bullock, took over the role on September 17. 

The month saw a sharp repricing of bond markets, with yields rising to cycle highs. Australian 2-year and 10- 10-year bond yields rose 25bps and 46bps, respectively, and the Bloomberg AusBond Composite 0+ Yr Index returned -1.53%. Despite inflation rates falling and economic data showing a slowing economy, bond markets appear to be repricing due to trader expectations that central banks will maintain higher interest rates for a prolonged period. 

The story was similar in the US, with the Federal Reserve holding the target cash rate steady at 5.25%-5.50%, citing easing inflation pressures and concerns of slowing economic growth. Despite the rate hike respite, bond markets experienced a poor month, correlating positively with equity markets. US 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields rose 18bps and 46bps, respectively, and the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index (AUD) returned -2.58% over the month.

###Currencies

The Australian dollar (AUD) appreciated over the month of September, losing 0.8% higher in trade-weighted terms to 61.1, strengthening against the Pound Sterling (GBP), Euro (EUR) and the Japanese Yen (JPY) whilst depreciating against the US Dollar (USD).

Volatility continued throughout the month, primarily influenced by relative US strength driven by US Employment data, shifting US bond yields, and 
messaging from the Fed's September meeting. 

Additionally, economic indications from China, including a slump in the Caisin China Services PMI, influenced the AUD.

The USD appreciated 0.5% against the AUD during September, while GBP was the laggard of the month, with GBPAUD depreciating by 3.2%.  

Year-on-year, the AUD has depreciated against the GBP and EUR by -8% and -6.8%, respectively, whilst appreciating against the USD and JPY by 0.6% and 3.7%, respectively.

##Economic key points

###Australia

The unemployment rate was steady at 3.7% in August, matching market forecasts. Retail sales increased by 0.2% in August, below the market estimate of 0.3%, while annual sales rose 1.5%. These figures indicate that 
consumers continue to reign in spending as interest rates remain elevated.

###Global

weakness of its property sector.

###US

US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at 5.25-5.5%. Still, it released an updated "dot plot" for the future trajectory of rates, which proved more hawkish than previous expectations. Most policymakers anticipate one further 0.25% increase in the remainder of 2023, and the median expectations are for only 0.50% in rate cuts through calendar 2024, compared to double this level indicated in the last dot plot. 

Accompanying commentary confirmed that the Fed now sees the battle to return inflation to its 2% target stretching out to 2026. Annual inflation rose to 3.7% in August, above the expected 3.6%.

The US economy added 336,000 jobs in September, nearly double the anticipated 170,000. The unemployment rate was static at 3.8% in September. The labour market remains tight, adding leeway for the 
Federal Reserve to leave borrowing costs at restrictive levels for a prolonged period.

better than the forecast US$62.3 deficit.

###Eurozone

The European Central Bank raised interest rates to 4.5%, the 10th consecutive rise, signalling that it is likely done tightening policy, as inflation has started to decline but is still expected to remain too high for too long.

Annual inflation fell to 4.3% in September, below the market consensus of 4.5%. The ECB forecasts average inflation at 5.6% in 2023 and 3.2% in 2024, both higher than previous estimates, primarily due to an elevated path for energy prices. 

PPI rose 0.6% in August, in line with market expectations, with the annual rate falling 11.5% as energy costs continue to fall.

Unemployment came in at 6.4% for August, matching the market forecast.

###UK

The Bank of England held rates at 5.25% in September as policymakers opted for a wait-and-see approach as the inflation and labour data suggests the accumulated impacts of previous policy tightening might be taking effect. 

Annual inflation eased to 6.7%% in August, below the expected 7.0%, primarily due to the slowdown in food inflation. PPI fell be 0.4% in August, compared to market expectations of a 0.6% decline. 

The unemployment rate increased to 4.3% in July, slightly above expectations, indicating that the labour market may be cooling off after months of unprecedented monetary policy tightening by the Bank 
of England.

Consumer confidence rose to -21 in September, above the expected -.27 amid growing optimism about the economy and easing pressures on household spending. 

Retail sales rose 0.4% in August, just below the market forecasts of a 0.5% increase. Annual sales fell 1.4%, more than the expected -1.2%.
The composite PMI index fell to 46.8 in September, driven by the continued contraction in manufacturing and a steep decline in the services sector.

###China

The unemployment rate dropped to 5.2% in August, matching June's 16 month low of 5.2%. Annual inflation came in at 0.1% in August, below 
market expectations of 0.2%, with core inflation increasing 0.8%. Annual Retail sales grew 4.6% in August, exceeding market estimates of 3.0%. 
Composite PMI fell to 50.9 in September, as new orders rose at a softer pace with manufacturers and service providers recording only marginal increases in sales.

This suggests the downturn in growth may be stabilising, but real estate remains a weak spot in the economy with property investment falling 8.8% in 2023.

###Japan
