The global recovery is underway and is looking sufficiently V-shaped, but recent economic news has been mixed. Infection rates have risen in the US and Europe, causing a loss of momentum, but news of successful vaccine trials from multiple companies has boosted confidence. Central bank policy remains remarkably accommodative, and fiscal spending is supporting jobs and income.

Globally there were over 60 million confirmed Covid-19 cases at the start of December and numbers continue to rise in the US, South America and Europe. The UK has begun rolling out the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, while Australia and the US are preparing to do the same once the vaccine is approved.

### Australia

Australia’s economic recovery has found solid footing, underpinned by low Covid-19 case numbers nationwide and news of successful vaccine trials.

At its December meeting, the Reserve Bank of Australia left interest rates unchanged at a record low 0.10%. The board anticipates no increase in the cash rate for at least three years, while the size of the bond purchase program will remain under review and dependent on the outlook for jobs and inflation.   The 3-year bond yield target remains at 0.10%.

Since the start of 2020, the RBA has expanded its balance sheet by $130 billion, and under its new quantitative easing program, the RBA will buy $100 billion worth of bonds over the next six months. These measures have helped to keep funding costs low, extend much-needed liquidity to businesses, and support balance sheets. RBA Governor Lowe stated the bank will continue to review its policy settings and is prepared to do more if necessary. Lowe said the bank is paying close attention to asset prices and household debt but considers unemployment to be the most significant risk to stability, rather than excess borrowing.

GDP grew 3.3% in the September quarter, beating expectations of 2.6%. Household consumption gained the most on record, increasing 7.9% following the sharp fall in the previous quarter of 12.5%, while government spending rose 1.4%. Recent data generally point to sustained growth, but we expect the recovery to be uneven and dependent on fiscal support. 

Retail sales increased 1.4% in October, slightly below the 1.6% expected, bouncing back from a 1.1% fall in the previous month. Building permits followed on from the 16.2% increase in September, gaining a further 3.8% in October, well ahead of expectations of a 3.0% fall. 

Labour force data showed employment surged in October, adding 178,800 jobs and confounding expectations for a fall of 30,000. The unemployment rate still rose to 7.0%, however, largely due to the participation rate unexpectedly climbing to 65.8%. Full-time employment increased by 97,000 to 8,643,700 people, and part-time employment increased by 81,800 to 4,130,200 people. 

The AiG Performance of Manufacturing Index revealed continued expansion in the manufacturing sector, but at a significantly slower pace, falling to 52.1 in November from 56.3 in the previous month. 

Optimism abounds according to the latest Westpac-MI Consumer Sentiment Index, which lifted to 112 in December from 107.7 in November. 

Westpac noted that, after only eight months, it seems clear that sentiment has fully recovered from the Covid recession. The ‘economy, next 12 months’ sub-index rose 9.9% to 111.9, a ten-year high, thanks to Australia’s relative success in combatting the pandemic. The ‘economy, next five years’ sub-index rose 5.9% to 121.1, the strongest reading since December 2009. 

China has ramped up its trade conflict with Australia, putting tariffs of up to 200% on Australian wine and suspending the importation of beef from a sixth Australian supplier. Timber log imports from QLD, VIC, TAS and SA have also been suspended by China, along with previously advised barley. China’s list of concerns includes the banning of Huawei and ZTE from Australia’s 5G network, as well as Australia’s “incessant wanton interference in China’s Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Taiwan affairs”.
