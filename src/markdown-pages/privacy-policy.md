  Privacy Principles.


  ### Our commitment to you


  We take your right to privacy seriously, and the secure handling of your information is our top priority. This Policy explains our approach to the management of personal information, including:


  * How we may collect, maintain, use and disclose your information.

  * The types of information that we collect and record.

  * Your privacy rights, along with our rights and obligations.


  In seeking financial advice from a representative of Walbrook, you consent to Walbrook collecting, maintaining, using and disclosing your personal information in accordance with this Policy.


  ### Information that we collect and hold


  Personal information means information, or an opinion about, an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion. Before we provide you with financial services, the Corporations Act 2001, Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 and financial services regulations require us to obtain certain personal information. The information we may collect includes, but is not limited to, the following:


  * Information that identifies you, such as your name, address, date of birth, Tax File Number (TFN), Tax Identification Number (TIN), nationality and contact details.

  * Your financial needs and objectives.

  * Your assets and liabilities (current and future), income and expenses.

  * Information regarding your dependents, beneficiaries, insurance claims history, health information and family commitments.

  * Your occupation, employment history, employment circumstances, family commitments, and social security eligibility.

  * Your superannuation and insurance details, including transaction history

  * Your investment preferences, risk ability, risk tolerance, investment knowledge and investment experience


  All information that we request is for our business purposes, which are summarised in this document and more specifically in forms and disclosure documents, e.g. Statements of Advice. Any form used to collect your information may give further details about the way we use your data.


  ### Sensitive Information


  We do not collect sensitive information unless we need it to provide you with the financial services that you have requested. For example, sensitive information includes details of your medical history or criminal record.


  If we do have to collect sensitive information, we will only collect, use and disclose it in accordance with privacy laws.


  ### Identification Numbers


  In certain circumstances, we are required to collect government identifiers such as your Tax Identification Number (Tax File Number), Medicare number or pension card number. We do not use or disclose this information other than when required, authorised by law or unless you have voluntarily consented to disclose this information to any third party.


  We may also be required to collect information relating to your tax residency. This data is necessary to comply with information sharing agreements that the Australian Government has entered into with other countries. These agreements include the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).


  ### How we collect your information


  Generally, we only collect personal information about you from you, unless it is unreasonable or impractical for us to do so, or if you consent to a third-party releasing information to us. For example, we may collect information your accountant, a product provider, or your employer for superannuation purposes.


  Where we obtain information from you directly, this is generally accomplished in meetings, by phone, by email, forms and when you visit our website or those of our external service providers.


  Sometimes we act as an intermediary for others when collecting information about you, such as to assist you to apply for insurance. We will inform you when we do this.


  We may collect information from you about another individual. A typical example is where you provide us with details of your nominated beneficiaries. Please ensure you are authorised to disclose that information, make the individual or individuals aware of the disclosure and provide them with this document.


  ### Collection of information via our website


  We also collect statistical information about visitors to our website. Examples of the information we collect include browser type, operating system, the number of visitors, pages viewed, types of transactions conducted, time online and documents downloaded.

However, where you choose not to provide us with the required information, we may not be able to offer you the services that you have requested from us.


  If you provide us with inaccurate or incomplete information, it may result in you obtaining products or services that are not suitable for your needs. Incorrect or incomplete information may increase the risk that you will suffer a financial loss.


  ### What happens if we obtain information about you which we have not solicited?


  Where we receive unsolicited personal information about you, we will consider if we could have collected the information if we had solicited the information. 


  Where we determine that we could have collected the personal information from you, we will treat your information as if we have sought the information directly from you.

  ### Overseas Disclosure and Storage of Personal Information


  We use cloud infrastructure that is physically located in Australia and have carried out suitable due diligence on our cloud service providers.


  We may offer you access to a personal wealth portal provided by myprosperity Aust Pty Ltd (‘myprosperity’). Data provided to myprosperity by you, Walbrook and financial institutions linked to your personal wealth portal is stored with Yodlee Inc in the United States of America.


  We may transfer personal information to other financial product and service providers in locations outside Australia when using or disclosing it for one of the purposes referred to above. We may need your consent before this occurs. When transferring personal information to foreign jurisdictions, we take reasonable steps to ensure the overseas recipient does not breach the Australian Privacy Principles.


  ### How we store and secure your personal information


  We take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. We have physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information held by us. For example, we store your personal information in secured office premises and encrypted electronic databases requiring logins and passwords for access. We require all staff to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information.


  We use secure methods to destroy or de-identify any personal information as soon as the law permits, and we no longer need it for any purpose. Legislative and professional requirements generally require that we retain your personal information for seven years after you cease to be a client.


  ### Correction of Information


  We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect, use and disclose is accurate, complete, relevant and up-to-date. Please promptly notify us if there are any changes to your personal information.


  If you become aware or believe that any personal information which we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you may contact us to correct the information.


  If we disagree as to the accuracy of the information and refuse to correct the personal data, we will give you a written notice to that effect. If we believe that we are unable to comply with your request to access information that you have provided us, we will give you written notice. You may request that we make an appropriate notation to that information noting you consider it is not accurate, complete or up to date.


  You have a right to make a complaint if you disagree with our decisions concerning these matters (see 'Complaints' below).


  ### Access to your personal information


  You may request access at any time to the personal information we hold about you. You can do this by contacting us with your request, stating the information you require. We will respond to your request within a reasonable period, usually 14 days for a straightforward application. Sometimes we are not required to provide you with access. If we refuse, we will tell you the reason why.


  Where we provide you access to such information, we may charge a reasonable fee to cover our costs. We will disclose the amount of such costs to you before providing you with the information.


  ### Your rights if you are in the European Economic Area (EEA)
