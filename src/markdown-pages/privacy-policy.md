  ## Our commitment to you


  ## **Our commitment to you**


  We take your right to privacy seriously and the secure handling of your information is our top priority. This Policy explains our approach to the management of personal information, including:


  * the types of information that we keep on record and how we may use that information

  * your privacy rights along with our general rights and obligations

  * our policies in relation to how we collect, maintain, use and disclose your personal information.


  When you seek financial advice from a representative of Walbrook, you consent to Walbrook collecting, maintaining, using and disclosing personal information about you (provided by you or by another person) in accordance with the privacy statements in relevant documents, any agreements you sign and this Policy.


  ## **Information that we collect and hold**


  Personal information means information, or an opinion about, an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion. As an Australian Financial Services Licensee, we provide you with financial services and may be required by the Corporations Act 2001, Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 and regulatory requirements to seek to obtain certain personal information about you. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:


  * Information that identifies you, such as your name, address, date of birth, Tax File Number (TFN), Tax Identification Number (TIN), nationality/ies and contact details.

  * Your financial needs and objectives.

  * Your assets and liabilities (current and future), income and expenses.

  * Information regarding your dependents, beneficiaries, insurance claims history, health information and family commitments.

  * Your occupation, employment history, employment circumstances, family commitments, and social security eligibility.

  * Your superannuation and insurance details, including transaction history

  * Your investment preferences, risk ability, risk tolerance, investment knowledge and investment experience


  All information sought is required for our business purposes, which are detailed generally in this document and more specifically in forms and disclosure documents e.g. Statements of Advice. Any form used to collect your information may give more specific details about the way we use your information.


  ## **Sensitive Information**


  We do not actively seek to collect sensitive information (for example health information or information about any criminal record), unless it is necessary for us to perform our functions or activities in advising you and dealing on your behalf. If we do have to collect sensitive information, we will only collect, use and disclose it in accordance with privacy laws.


  ## **Identification Numbers**


  Although in certain circumstances we are required to collect government identifiers such as your Tax Identification Number (Tax File Number), Medicare number or pension card number, we do not use or disclose this information other than when required, authorised by law or unless you have voluntarily consented to disclose this information to any third party.


  We may also be required to collect information relating to your tax residency status. This is required to comply with information sharing agreements that the Australian Government has entered into with other countries, such as our obligations under the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).


  ## **How we collect your information**


  Generally, Walbrook only collects personal information about you from you, unless it is not reasonable or practical for us to do so or if you consent to a third-party releasing information to us. For example, we may collect information from a third party, like your accountant or a product provider, or your employer for superannuation purposes.


  Where we obtain the information from you directly, this is generally obtained in meetings, by phone, by email, in data collection forms and when you visit our website or those of our external service providers.


  Sometimes we act as an intermediary for others when collecting information about you, such as for the purpose of assisting you to apply for insurance. We will inform you when we do this.


  Where we collect information from you about another individual, for example your nominated beneficiaries, please ensure that you are entitled to disclose that information to us and make that individual aware of the disclosure and the contents of this document.


  ## **Collection of information via our website**


  Walbrook also collects some statistical information about visitors to our website (for example, browser type, operating system, the number of visitors, pages viewed, types of transactions conducted, time online and documents downloaded). This information is used in an aggregated manner to analyse how people use our website and to improve our website.


  Some of this statistical information is collected by using cookies. Cookies are small data files that are downloaded from our website and stored on your computer when you visit our website. We use this information only for the purposes of evaluating our website performance (including identifying potential performance problems) and continually improving our services. None of the statistical information we prepare from information collected using cookies identifies individual visitors to our websites.


  Your computer’s web browser will allow you to configure your computer to refuse to accept cookies. You can also delete cookies from your computer’s hard drive at any time. Doing so should not negatively impact your experience on our website.


  Other than for statistical information, we do not collect any information about you via our websites unless you provide the information to us or a service provider that we have linked to.You have control over any personal information we collect from you through online forms, "contact us" messages, including chat transcripts, emails to us or email newsletter subscription information. Any information collected will be used for the purposes for which the information was requested and other related purposes and will only be disclosed with your consent or when required or authorised by or under law.


  You may be able to access external websites, including those of other service providers, by clicking on links we have provided. Those other websites are not subject to our privacy standards, policies and procedures. You will need to contact or review those websites directly to ascertain their privacy standards, policies and procedures.


  ## **Are you obliged to provide us personal information?**


  Unless required by law (for example, to comply with a legal duty of disclosure when applying for an insurance product), you are not required to provide us the information that we request, or to allow us to collect information from third parties. However, where you choose not to provide us with the information we request, we may not be able to provide you with services that you have requested from us.


  Importantly, if you provide either inaccurate or incomplete information to us you risk obtaining products or services that may not be appropriate or suitable for your needs and you may risk suffering a financial loss.


  ## **What happens if we obtain information about you which we have not solicited?**


  Where we receive unsolicited personal information about you, we will consider if we could have collected the information if we had solicited the information. Where we determine that we could have collected the personal information from you, we will treat your personal information in the same manner as if we have solicited the information directly from you. Where we determine that we could not have collected the personal information, we will destroy the information or ensure that the information is de-identified as soon as practicable.


  ## **How we use your information**


  We use your personal information for the primary purpose for which the information was obtained. This means that generally we, as an AFSL holder, use your personal information to:


  * Assist us in providing financial services to you

  * Implement investment or risk management recommendations on your behalf

  * Ensure we are compliant with our legal and regulatory obligations

  * Process any complaints

  * Ensure our business is running compliantly and efficiently, which amongst other practices may include confidential systems maintenance and testing etc


  We may also use the information for the secondary purpose of identifying and marketing other products or services that may be of interest to you.


  ## **Use of your personal information by a Product Provider or Insurer**


  If you acquire a product from an Insurer or product provider (such as a Responsible Entity or Fund Manager), they may use personal information about you for purposes as disclosed in their own privacy policy and in the disclosure document for the product or service you choose. You can obtain a copy of their privacy policy by contacting the Insurer or product provider directly.


  ## **When we disclose your personal information**


  Generally, we must obtain your consent before we tell anyone about you, or your investments. You can give us your consent expressly (by telephone or writing to us) or it may be implied by your conduct. 


  Sometimes the law requires or allows us to give out information about you. For example, we may be required to give your information to AUSTRAC or product providers for anti-money laundering purposes. Another example is giving your investment details to a court if we are ordered to do so under a subpoena.


  We may also disclose your personal information to the entities described below.


  * Our external service providers. This is on a confidential basis and includes but is not limited to organisations that provide us with financial, advisory, administrative, client relationship management, information technology or other services.

  * The product issuers of products and services that you have elected to acquire, vary or dispose of using our assistance, and other organisations who support the products and services we offer.

  * Other parties involved in the administration of your financial products or insurance cover (e.g. custodians, credit reporting bodies, actuaries, call centres, mail houses, product registries, any persons who propose to guarantee (or have guaranteed) repayment of any credit provided to you, claims assessors etc.)

  * Your professional advisers, including your solicitor or accountant, as authorised by you.

  * Any party acquiring, or considering acquiring, an interest in our business

  * A complaints body to whom a complaint relating to a product or service is referred

  * Government and regulatory authorities and other organisations, as required or authorised by law.


  For insurance products, where required by law, we may disclose personal information about you to the Insurer without getting your consent. These parties are required to comply with the privacy laws in using any such information.


  ## **Overseas Disclosure and Storage of Personal Information**


  Our policy is to only use cloud or other types of networked or electronic storage where infrastructure is physically located in Australia. We have carried out our due diligence regarding our cloud service providers and have entered into suitable contractual arrangements with them.


  We may transfer personal information to financial product and service providers in locations outside Australia (including, but not limited to, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom), when using or disclosing it for one of the purposes referred to above. We may need your consent before this occurs. When transferring personal information to foreign jurisdictions, we take reasonable steps to ensure the overseas recipient does not breach the Australian Privacy Principles in relation to the information.


  ## **How we store and secure your personal information**


  We take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. We have physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information held by us. For example, your personal information is stored in secured office premises, in encrypted electronic databases requiring logins and passwords for access and/or at a secured warehouse. We require all staff to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information.


  We use secure methods to destroy or de-identify any personal information as soon as the law permits, provided the information is no longer needed by us for any purpose. Legislative and professional requirements generally require that we retain your personal information for 7 years after you cease to be a client.


  ## **Correction of Information**


  We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect, use and disclose is accurate, complete, relevant and up-to-date. Please promptly notify us if there are any changes to your personal information.


  In the event that you become aware, or believe, that any personal information which we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you may contact us to correct the information.


  If we disagree as to the accuracy of the information, and refuse to correct the personal information, or if we believe that we are unable to comply with your request to access the personal information that you have provided us, we will give you a written notice to that effect. You may request that we make an appropriate notation in relation to that information noting you consider it is not accurate, complete or up to date.


  You have a right to make a complaint if you disagree with our decisions in relation to these matters (see ‘Complaints’ below).


  ## **Access to your personal information**


  You may request access at any time to the personal information we hold about you. You can do this by contacting us with your request, stating the information you require. We will respond within a reasonable period after the request is made, usually 14 days for a straightforward request. Sometimes we are not required to provide you with access. If we refuse, we will tell you the reason why.


  Where we provide you access to such information, we may charge a reasonable fee to cover our costs. We will disclose the amount of such costs to you prior to providing you with the information.
