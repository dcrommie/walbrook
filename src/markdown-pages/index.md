reviews:
  - review: I had several meetings with Damien to sort out my finances and to help
      set up my income stream from my super. Damien spent some time
      understanding my needs and wants as well as my risk appetite. Once Damien
      had the information he then put in place a financial plan that suited my
      needs. Within a couple of weeks my income stream was in place and my
      finances were in order... Damien did all the interactions with all the
      financial institutions and took all the stress out of the process. Damien
      has great attention to detail and follows up to keep you informed. I now
      have a financial plan that works for me ... thanks Damien !!
