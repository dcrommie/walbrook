reviews:
  - review: Damien helped us sort out our finances and set up an income stream from
      my super. He discussed our needs with us and then prepared a financial
      plan. Within a couple of weeks, our income streams were in place. Walbrook
      handled the interactions with the financial institutions and took all the
      stress out of the process.

  - review: Damien helped me to create a goals-based financial plan.  He prepared
      investment recommendations that best fit these goals and was able to
      explain the details in understandable terms to a relative financial
      novice. My knowledge of investing increased dramatically, enabling further
      growth and understanding.

  - review: Damien managed my savings for eight years while he was living in the UK
      and I enjoyed our relationship.  He is very trustworthy, straight-forward
      and always available when needed.  He is a great professional.

  - review: We consolidated our private wealth accounts with Damien at Julius
      Baer.  Damien ensured that the transfer process was smooth, timely and
      tax-efficient.  Post the transfer, he co-ordinated investment advisory,
      tax and financial planning, rewriting of wills and setting up Power of
      Attorneys. An amazing job.
