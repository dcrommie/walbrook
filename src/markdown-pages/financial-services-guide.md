  ### Personal financial product advice


  We are authorised to provide both general and personal financial product advice. Personal financial product advice is advice that considers your objectives, financial situation and needs. We must act in your best interests when providing you with personal financial product advice. Within the subject matter of the advice we provide to you, we must ensure that:


  * the scope of the advice includes all the issues for the advice to meet your objectives, financial situation and needs (including your risk tolerance and risk ability);

  * where the scope of the advice changes, the change is consistent with your objectives, financial situation and needs; and

  * we consider whether to provide advice that recommends a specific product, whether you should dispose of a product or whether you should do nothing.

   To provide you with this advice, we will make reasonable enquiries about your current financial situation, objectives and needs. We ask that you:

  * provide us with complete, current and accurate details of your personal objectives, financial situation and needs; and

  * inform of us of any changes in your situation.


  ### Delivery of advice


  By law, you are entitled to receive a Statement of Advice on the first occasion that we provide you with personal advice. The Statement of Advice will contain: 


  * the specific advice; 

  * the basis of the specific advice; 

  * information about fees and commissions;

  * any associations or relationships we have that may influence the advice we provide to you;

  * any other relevant matters.


  If we provide further personal advice to you after we have issued an initial Statement of Advice, and your circumstances have not significantly changed, we may provide you with a Record of Advice. We will retain copies of each Statement of Advice and Record of Advice on your file for at least seven (7) years. You may request a copy of either document within that period by contacting your financial adviser.


  We are not required to provide you with a Statement of Advice or a Record of Advice where the advice relates to certain basic deposit products or other approved financial products and meets certain thresholds.


  As our ongoing advice will refer to previous documentation, you should keep all Statements of Advice provided to you.


  ### General Financial Product Advice


  At times, we may provide you with general financial product advice. Where we provide you with general advice or an execution only service, we will also provide you with a general advice warning. You should note that general advice does not relate specifically to you and does not take into consideration your objectives, financial situation and needs. Whilst Walbrook believes the general advice provided is accurate and reliable, neither Walbrook nor its directors or employees assume any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the information provided.


  ### Product Disclosure Statements


  Where a recommendation has been made to acquire a financial product, we will provide you with a Product Disclosure Statement. The product provider issues the Product Disclosure Statement, which contains information about the features, costs, risks and benefits. It will help you to make an informed decision about whether or not to invest in the financial product.


  It is essential that you read and understand this document before implementing any recommendation made in the Statement of Advice or Record of Advice. We will readily explain any part of this document that you do not understand.


  Your adviser will also provide other documents as needed. These documents may include educational material, client agreements or other offer documents. 


  ### Electronic Disclosure


  We may provide disclosure documents, including this FSG and the documents outlined above, by making them available digitally, e.g. by email attachment or as a hyperlink in a document or email. You can contact us to opt-out of this method of disclosure at any time.


  ### How you may instruct us


  You may give us instructions verbally or in writing, such as by email or letter. In limited circumstances and where required by third parties, we may require your instructions in writing.


  Where you do not wish to receive our advice or reject the advice we have provided, we may still act on your instructions to deal in financial products. However:


  * you must acknowledge and accept the risk that the financial product you select may not be suitable or appropriate for you, and

  * we may require you to sign a document that records your intention to proceed without or against advice in relation to the financial products.


  ### How you pay for the financial services we provide to you


  We believe in a transparent and straightforward fee structure and do not accept upfront or trailing commissions on any investments or insurance products that we recommend to you, nor do we accept volume-based benefits from platform or product providers.


  Fees are calculated individually for each client, determined by the level of service you require and the complexity of the advice and administration needed to meet your objectives and needs. 


  If you receive personal advice from us, we will tell you about any fees, commissions and any other benefits, in actual dollar amounts (where possible) in the Statement of Advice or orally when providing further advice to you. 

  If you receive ongoing services from us over a period of more than 12 months, then we are also required to provide you with an annual Fee Disclosure Statement which will set out the fees paid, and the services offered and provided in the previous 12 months.


  You can settle your fees by deduction from your investment portfolio or via bank transfer. In certain circumstances, you may be able to have charges deducted from your superannuation balance.

  ### Fees you pay for using other financial services or products


  The total initial and ongoing costs of using our service will depend on the fees charged by third-party issuers of the financial products and services we recommend.


  These fees will be outlined in the Statements of Advice and Records of Advice that we prepare, to provide you with a clear understanding of the total initial and ongoing costs of the recommended actions. The Product Disclosure Statements that we will provide, issued by the relevant third parties, will also give more detail.


  ### Conflicts of interest, associations or relationships that may affect our advice


  As an independent wealth manager that is not owned by a bank or product manufacturer, we do not manage or distribute our own financial products. Any help we provide is concerning financial products from non-related product providers.


  Our representatives receive a base salary and own an indirect beneficial interest in the company. We therefore do not accept any product or volume related commissions, incentives or bonuses that may typically be received by the holder of an AFSL. This policy helps us to limit the risk that conflicts of interest pose to sound financial advice.


  We may negotiate reduced charges on some investments or products we recommend, with any benefits negotiated passed onto clients. We do not accept any form of incentive in these arrangements.


  We may receive non-monetary benefits from product providers. Walbrook representatives may only accept non-monetary benefits that are valued at less than AUD 300 and we are required to keep records of non-monetary benefits valued between AUD 100 - AUD 300. Records of non-monetary benefits received by our representatives are kept in our Alternative Forms of Remuneration Register. If you would like a copy of the Register, please contact us.


  ##### Referral arrangements


  We do not currently pay anyone to refer clients to us, nor do we accept payments for referrals to other professionals. If you have been referred to us and we do decide to pay a referral fee, the details will be disclosed in your Statement of Advice and paid as agreed with you and permitted by law.


  ##### Employee Trading


  We and our representatives may invest in similar or the same investments as those recommended to you. Walbrook implements a Staff Trading Policy to mitigate risks and conflicts which may arise from trading activity in such investments. If you would like to discuss this with us or obtain further information about our policy, feel free to contact us.


  ### How we protect your personal information


  Protecting your privacy is important to us and central to our commitment to meeting the highest level of professional standards. We will handle your personal information per our Privacy Policy, which outlines how the information we collect from you is used, stored and disclosed.


  We will collect your personal information from the conversations you have and forms you complete with our representatives. As a financial service provider, we are obligated to verify your identity and the source of any funds, pursuant to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act (AML/CTF Act) and its corresponding rules and regulations. Accordingly, we will request identification documents, such as your passport or drivers’ licence, and hold certified copies of these documents on file.


  The main reason we collect, use and disclose your personal information, is to provide you with the products and services that you request. This reason may also include the following related purposes:


  * To help us provide you with financial advice and ongoing financial services

  * To facilitate internal administration, accounting, research, risk management, compliance and evaluation of products and services

  * To establish and maintain insurance protection that you may request; and

  * To provide you with information about other products and services that may be suitable for you.


  We may be required to obtain information about you at the time of providing financial services to you and from time to time in order to meet our legal obligations. We have certain reporting obligations pursuant to the AML/CTF Act, and information obtained from or about you may be provided to external third parties and regulators in accordance with the requirements imposed on us.


  We may also disclose your information to external parties, some of whom act on your or our behalf. These parties may include:


  * External compliance consultants

  * Banks or other financial institutions

  * Insurers and reinsurers and their claims agents and assessors

  * Product providers; and

  * Mail houses.


  We are also permitted to collect and disclose your personal information when required or authorised to do so by law. To obtain a copy of our Privacy Policy, please contact us or visit www.walbrook.com.au.


  If you have concerns about the accuracy and completeness of the information we hold, you may request access to your data by contacting the Privacy Officer on +61 3 9013 6262.
