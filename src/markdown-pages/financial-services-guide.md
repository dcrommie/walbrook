  ## Other important documents you may receive from us


  In addition to this FSG, you can expect to receive the following important documents over the course of your relationship with us. 


  ### Statement of Advice


  By law, you are entitled to receive a Statement of Advice on the first occasion that we provide you with personal advice.


  The Statement of Advice will contain the advice, the basis of the advice, information about fees, payments and any associations we have that may influence the advice we provide to you.


  ### Record of Advice


  Subsequent personal advice that we provide to you will be documented in a Record of Advice, provided there has not been a significant change in your circumstances or the basis upon which we prepared your last Statement of Advice. In limited circumstances, where initial advice relates to specific products with amounts under certain thresholds, we may provide a Record of Advice in place of a Statement of Advice.


  We will retain copies of each Statement of Advice and Record of Advice on your file. You may request a copy by contacting your financial adviser.


  ### Product Disclosure Statements


  Where a recommendation has been made to acquire a financial product, we will provide you with a Product Disclosure Statement. The product provider issues the Product Disclosure Statement, which contains information about the features, costs, risks and benefits. It will help you to make an informed decision about whether or not to invest in or buy the financial product.


  It is essential that you read and understand this document before implementing any recommendation made in the Statement of Advice or Record of Advice. We will readily explain any part of this document that you do not understand.


  ## Electronic Disclosure


  We may provide disclosure documents, including this FSG and the documents outlined above, by making them available digitally, e.g. by email attachment or as a hyperlink in a document or email. You can contact us to opt-out of this method of disclosure at any time.


  ## How we provide you with personal financial advice


  Personal financial advice is advice that considers your financial objectives, financial situation and financial needs. We must act in your best interests when providing you with personal financial advice. Within the subject matter of the advice we provide to you, we must ensure that:


  * The scope of the advice includes all the issues for the advice to meet your objectives, financial situation and needs (including your risk tolerance and risk ability)

  * If the scope of the advice changes, the change is consistent with your objectives, financial situation and needs; and

  * We consider whether to provide advice that recommends a specific product, whether you should dispose of a product or whether you should do nothing.


  To provide you with this advice, we ask that you:


  * Provide us with complete, current and accurate details of your personal objectives, financial situation and needs; and

  * Inform of us of any changes in your situation.


  We will always provide our advice to you in a Statement of Advice, unless it is further advice.


  ## Further advice


  If you require further advice, we must ensure that the basis on which we provided the original advice has not significantly changed. Therefore, we may need to recheck your circumstances before giving any further advice.


  If there has not been a material change in circumstances and a new Statement of Advice is not required, further advice will be in the form of a Record of Advice. We will keep the Record of Advice on file for seven (7) years, during which time you may request a copy from your financial adviser.


  We are not required to provide you with a Statement of Advice or a Record of Advice where the advice relates to certain basic deposit productsor other approved financial products.


  As our ongoing advice will refer to previous documentation, you should keep all Statements of Advice provided to you.


  ## Your instructions to us


  You may give us your instructions verbally or in writing, such as by email or letter. In limited circumstances and where required by third parties, we may require your instructions in writing.


  Where you do not wish to receive our advice or reject the advice we have provided, we may still act on your instructions. However:


  * You must acknowledge and accept the risk that the financial product you select may not be suitable or appropriate for you, and

  * We may require you to sign a document that records your intention to proceed without or against advice to acquire the financial products.


  ## How you pay for the financial services we provide to you


  We believe in a transparent and straightforward fee structure and do not accept upfront or trailing commissions on any investments or insurance products that we recommend to you, nor do we accept volume-based benefits from platform or product providers.


  Fees are calculated individually for each client, determined by the level of service you require, and the complexity of the advice and administration needed to meet your objectives.


  You can settle your fees by deduction from your investment portfolio or via bank transfer. In certain circumstances, you may be able to have charges deducted from your superannuation balance.


  We will agree the following fees with you, before commencing work at each stage:


  ### Initial Advice Fee


  Following the first meeting, we will agree a flat fee for the preparation of your initial Statement of Advice. Please note that there is no charge for the first meeting.


  The minimum initial advice fee is AUD 2,500, inclusive of GST.


  ### Implementation Fee


  On completion of the Statement of Advice, we will calculate an implementation fee. If you request our assistance to implement the recommendations made, we will charge the implementation fee. We will disclose this fee and the implementation services it covers in the Statement of Advice.


  There is no minimum implementation fee.


  ### Ongoing Service Fee


  Where we recommend an ongoing service, we will calculate a fixed annual fee and disclose this, along with the specific ongoing services that we will provide, in the Statement of Advice.


  The ongoing services and cost will also be confirmed to you in a Fee Disclosure Statement before commencement and reviewed every year thereafter.


  The minimum ongoing service fee is AUD 3,500 per annum, inclusive of GST.


  ### Transaction and Administration Fees


  We do not charge transaction or administration fees on advised trades, including off-market transfers. Where we are asked to process transactions on an execution-only basis, we may charge a fee of up to 1.00% of the transaction value (minimum AUD 200). This fee does not include third-party costs.


  ## Fees you pay for using other financial services or products


  The total initial and ongoing costs of using our service will depend on the fees charged by third-party issuers of the financial products and services we recommend.


  These fees will be outlined in the Statements of Advice and Records of Advice that we prepare, to provide you with a clear understanding of the total initial and ongoing costs of the recommended actions. The Product Disclosure Statements that we will provide, issued by the relevant third parties, will also give more detail.


  ## Conflicts of interest, associations or relationships that may affect our advice


  As an independent wealth manager that is not owned by a bank or product manufacturer, we do not manage or distribute our own financial products. Any help we provide is concerning financial products from non-related product providers.


  Our representatives receive a base salary and own an indirect beneficial interest in the company. We therefore do not accept any product or volume related commissions, incentives or bonuses that may typically be received by the holder of an AFSL. This policy helps us to limit the risks that conflicts of interest pose to sound financial advice.


  We may negotiate reduced charges on some investments or products we recommend, with any benefits negotiated passed onto clients. We do not accept any form of incentive in these arrangements.


  We may receive non-monetary benefits from product providers, such as training. Per the relevant professional standard (APES 230 Financial Planning Services), we and our representatives may only accept non-monetary benefits that are valued at less than $300. These must be recorded in our Alternative Forms of Remuneration Register, which is available for inspection by our clients, regulators and professional bodies. Please contact us should you wish to review the Register.


  ## Employee Trading


  We and our representatives may invest in similar or the same investments as those recommended to you. These holdings are not capable of influencing the price or expected returns of the investments.


  ## Referral arrangements


  We do not currently pay anyone to refer clients to us, nor do we accept payments for referrals to other professionals. If you have been referred to us and we do decide to pay a referral fee, the details will be disclosed in your Statement of Advice and paid as agreed with you and permitted by law.


  ## How we protect your personal information


  Protecting your privacy is important to us and central to our commitment to meeting the highest level of professional standards. We will handle your personal information per our privacy policy, which outlines how the information we collect from you is used, stored and disclosed.


  We will collect your personal information from the conversations you have and forms you complete with our representatives. As a financial service provider, we are obligated to verify your identity and the source of any funds. Accordingly, we will request identification documents, such as your passport or drivers licence, and hold certified copies of these documents on file.


  The main reason we collect, use and disclose your personal information, is to provide you with the products and services that you request. This reason may also include the following related purposes:


  * To help us provide you with financial advice and ongoing financial services

  * To facilitate internal administration, accounting, research, risk management, compliance and evaluation of products and services

  * To establish and maintain insurance protection that you may request; and

  * To provide you with information about other products and services that may be suitable for you.


  We may also disclose your information to external parties, some of whom act on your or our behalf. These parties may include:


  * External compliance consultants

  * Banks or other financial institutions

  * Insurers and reinsurers and their claims agents and assessors

  * Product providers; and

  * Mail houses.


  We are also permitted to collect and disclose your personal information when required or authorised to do so by law.To obtain a copy of our Privacy Policy, please contact us or visit www.walbrook.com.au.


  If you have concerns about the accuracy and completeness of the information we hold, you may request access to your data by contacting the Privacy Officer on +61 3 9013 6262.

This insurance also covers claims concerning the conduct of representatives no longer working for us (but who did at the time of the relevant conduct).
