  ### Personal financial product advice\r

  \r

  We are authorised to provide both general and personal financial product
  advice. Personal financial product advice is advice that considers your
  objectives, financial situation and needs. We must act in your best interests
  when providing you with personal financial product advice. Within the subject
  matter of the advice we provide to you, we must ensure that:\r

  \r

  * the scope of the advice includes all the issues for the advice to meet
  your objectives, financial situation and needs (including your risk tolerance
  and risk ability);\r

  * where the scope of the advice changes, the change is consistent with your
  objectives, financial situation and needs; *and* \r

  * we consider whether to provide advice that recommends a specific product,
  whether you should dispose of a product or whether you should do nothing.\r

  \r

  To provide you with this advice, we will make reasonable enquiries about
  your current financial situation, objectives and needs. We ask that you:\r

  \r

  * provide us with complete, current and accurate details of your personal
  objectives, financial situation and needs; and\r

  * inform of us of any changes in your situation.\r

  \r

  ### Delivery of advice\r

  \r

  By law, you are entitled to receive a Statement of Advice on the first
  occasion that we provide you with personal advice. The Statement of Advice
  will contain:\r

  \r

  * the specific advice; \r

  * the basis of the specific advice;\r

  * information about fees and commissions; \r

  * any associations or relationships we have that may influence the advice we
  provide to you;\r

  * any other relevant matters.\r

  \r

  If we provide further personal advice to you after we have issued an initial
  Statement of Advice, and your circumstances have not significantly changed, we
  may provide you with a Record of Advice. We will retain copies of each
  Statement of Advice and Record of Advice on your file for at least seven (7)
  years. You may request a copy of either document within that period by
  contacting your financial adviser. \r

  \r

  We are not required to provide you with a Statement of Advice or a Record of
  Advice where the advice relates to certain basic deposit products or other
  approved financial products and meets certain thresholds.  \r

  \r

  As our ongoing advice will refer to previous documentation, you should keep
  all Statements of Advice provided to you.\r

  \r

  ### General financial product advice\r

  \r

  At times, we may provide you with general financial product advice. Where we
  provide you with general advice or an execution only service, we will also
  provide you with a general advice warning. You should note that general advice
  does not relate specifically to you and does not take into consideration your
  objectives, financial situation and needs. Whilst Walbrook believes the
  general advice provided is accurate and reliable, neither Walbrook nor its
  directors or employees assume any responsibility for the accuracy or
  completeness of the information provided.\r

  \r

  ### Product Disclosure Statements\r

  \r

  Where a recommendation has been made to acquire a financial product, we will
  provide you with a Product Disclosure Statement. The product provider issues
  the Product Disclosure Statement, which contains information about the
  features, costs, risks and benefits. It will help you to make an informed
  decision about whether or not to invest in the financial product. \r

  \r

  It is essential that you read and understand this document before
  implementing any recommendation made in the Statement of Advice or Record of
  Advice. We will readily explain any part of this document that you do not
  understand. \r

  \r

  Your adviser will also provide other documents as needed. These documents
  may include educational material, client agreements or other offer
  documents.\r

  \r

  ### Electronic Disclosure\r

  \r

  We may provide disclosure documents, including this FSG and the documents
  outlined above, by making them available digitally, e.g. by email attachment
  or as a hyperlink in a document or email. You can contact us to opt-out of
  this method of disclosure at any time.\r

  \r

  ### How you may instruct us\r

  \r

  You may give us instructions verbally or in writing, such as by email or
  letter. In limited circumstances and where required by third parties, we may
  require your instructions in writing. Where you do not wish to receive our
  advice or reject the advice we have provided, we may still act on your
  instructions to deal in financial products. However:\r

  \r

  * you must acknowledge and accept the risk that the financial product you
  select may not be suitable or appropriate for you, and\r

  * we may require you to sign a document that records your intention to
  proceed without or against advice in relation to the financial products.\r

  \r

  ### How you pay for the financial services we provide to you\r

  \r

  If you receive personal advice from us, we will tell you about any fees,
  commissions and any other benefits, in actual dollar amounts (where possible)
  in the Statement of Advice or orally when providing further advice to you.  \r

  \r

  There are several ways that Walbrook may be paid for the services we provide
  to you, including:\r

  \r

  * Fixed Fees, where you pay a fixed dollar or percentage-based fee for the
  services that we agree to provide;  \r

  * Asset-Based Fees, where you pay a percentage-based fee for the investment
  services that we agree to provide;\r

  * Commission, which is paid by product and service providers to Walbrook, in
  the form of initial (up-front) and/or ongoing (trail) commission; or\r

  * A combination of Fixed Fee, Asset-Based Fee and Commission.\r

  \r

  Under the Fixed Fee option, fees are calculated based on the level of
  service needed and the complexity of the advice required. All fees and
  commissions are inclusive of GST.\r

  inclusive of GST.\r

  * The minimum comprehensive advice fee is AUD 3,300, inclusive of GST.\r

  * The maximum comprehensive advice fee is AUD 11,000, inclusive of GST.\r

  \r

  tax structures such as Self Managed Superannuation Funds, Family Trusts and
  Companies are likely to be charged closer to the maximum fee. \r

  services it covers in the Statement of Advice. \r

  Walbrook may receive payments of initial commissions and ongoing commissions
  from the life insurance providers for any product that we have recommended and
  you elect to use. \r

  \r

  You do not make these payments to us, however, the life insurance provider
  incorporates these distribution costs in the premiums you pay. \r

  \r

  Initial commission from a life insurance provider is typically up to 66%
  (inclusive of GST) of the first year’s premium that you pay. \r

  \r

  For example, if you pay AUD 500 in premium for a life insurance product we
  have recommended to you and the applicable commission is 66%, then Walbrook
  will receive an initial commission of AUD 330 (i.e. AUD 500 x 66%). \r

  \r

  Ongoing commission can be up to 33% (inclusive of GST) of the premium you
  pay, from year two onwards for the life of the policy. \r

  \r

  If your premium is AUD 500 per annum and the applicable commission rate is
  33%, Walbrook will receive an ongoing commission of AUD 165 per annum. \r

  \r

  Your Statement of Advice will disclose the actual commission that Walbrook
  and your Adviser will receive. \r

  \r

  In accordance with APES 230: Financial Planning, we must write to you each
  year to disclose the commissions that we expect to receive.\r

  If authorised by an Australian Credit Licence holder as a Corporate Credit

  ongoing commission from lenders for any credit product that we have
  recommended and you have successfully applied for. \r

  \r

  You do not make these payments to us, however, the lender typically
  incorporates these distribution costs in their quoted interest rates and
  product fees. \r

  If you receive ongoing services from us over a period of more than 12
  months, then we are also required to provide you with an annual Fee Disclosure
  Statement which will set out the fees paid, and the services offered and
  provided in the previous 12 months. \r

  \r

  You can settle your fees by deduction from your investment portfolio or via
  bank transfer. In certain circumstances, you may be able to have charges
  deducted from your superannuation balance.\r

  \r

  ### Fees you pay for using other financial services or products\r

  \r

  The total initial and ongoing costs of using our service will depend on the
  fees charged by third-party issuers of the financial products and services we
  recommend. \r

  \r

  These fees will be outlined in the Statements of Advice and Records of
  Advice that we prepare, to provide you with a clear understanding of the total
  initial and ongoing costs of the recommended actions. The Product Disclosure
  Statements that we will provide, issued by the relevant third parties, will
  also give more detail.\r

  \r

  ### Conflicts of interest, associations or relationships that may affect our
  advice\r

  \r

  As a wealth manager that is not owned by a bank or product manufacturer, we
  do not manufacture or distribute our own financial products. Any assistance we
  provide is concerning financial products from third parties. We have an
  obligation to act in your best interests, to avoid conflicts and prioritise
  your interests.\r

  \r

  **Approved Product List**\r

  \r

  Our investment Approved Product List (APL) is based on research conducted by
  the third-party provider Lonsec. As Lonsec receives payments from financial
  product providers to be rated, this has the effect of limiting our investable
  universe to products whose issuers have paid Lonsec a fee. Our advice process
  provides clear guidelines for your adviser to recommend a product or security
  that is not on the APL, to avoid situations where the APL is unduly
  restrictive.\r

  \r

  **Adviser remuneration**\r

  \r

  Your financial adviser, Damien Crommie, receives a base salary and has an
  indirect beneficial interest in Walbrook. This means that he may receive a
  share of any profits distributed by Walbrook after licensing, legal,
  compliance, paraplanning, technology and administrative costs.\r

  \r

  **Non-monetary benefits**\r

  \r

  We may receive non-monetary benefits from product providers. Walbrook
  representatives may only accept non-monetary benefits that are valued at less
  than AUD 300 and we are required to keep records of non-monetary benefits
  valued between AUD 100 – AUD 300. Records of non-monetary benefits received by
  our representatives are kept in our Alternative Forms of Remuneration
  Register. If you would like a copy of the Register, please contact us.\r

  \r

  **Referral Arrangements**\r

  \r

  If you have been referred to us and we decide to pay a referral fee, the
  details will be disclosed in your Statement of Advice and paid as agreed with
  you and permitted by law. \r

  \r

  We may refer you to third parties where you are interested in receiving
  their services or using their products, or where we consider that their advice
  or other services may be useful to you. Walbrook may receive a referral fee
  where you decide to receive services from third party providers. This will be
  disclosed in writing and received as agreed with you and permitted by law.\r

  \r

  **Employee Trading**\r

  \r

  We and our representatives may invest in similar or the same investments as
  those recommended to you. If you would like to discuss this with us or obtain
  further information about how we mitigate any risks or conflicts that may
  arise because of this trading activity, please contact us.\r

  \r

  ### How we protect your personal information\r

  \r

  Protecting your privacy is important to us and central to our commitment to
  meeting the highest level of professional standards. We will handle your
  personal information per our Privacy Policy, which outlines how the
  information we collect from you is used, stored and disclosed. \r

  \r

  We will collect your personal information from the conversations you have
  and forms you complete with our representatives. As a financial service
  provider, we are obligated to verify your identity and the source of any
  funds, pursuant to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing
  Act (AML/CTF Act) and its corresponding rules and regulations. \r

  \r

  Accordingly, we will request identification documents, such as your passport
  or drivers’ licence, and may hold certified copies of these documents on file.
  \r

  \r

  With your consent, we may also share your full name, date of birth,
  residential address and contact details with an identity agent to help us
  verify your identity against government and non-government electronic data
  sources. Electronic verification allows us to verify your identity by using
  electronic tools and external data sources. \r

  \r

  The main reason we collect, use and disclose your personal information, is
  to provide you with the products and services that you request. This reason
  may also include the following related purposes:\r

  \r

  * to help us provide you with financial advice and ongoing financial
  services; \r

  * to facilitate internal administration, accounting, research, risk
  management, compliance and evaluation of products and services;\r

  * to establish and maintain insurance protection that you may request; and
  \r

  * to provide you with information about other products and services that may
  be suitable for you. \r

  \r

  We may be required to obtain information about you at the time of providing
  financial services to you and from time to time in order to meet our legal
  obligations. We have certain reporting obligations pursuant to the AML/CTF
  Act, and information obtained from or about you may be provided to external
  third parties and regulators in accordance with the requirements imposed on
  us. \r

  \r

  We may also disclose your information to external parties, some of whom act
  on your or our behalf. These parties may include:\r

  \r

  * External compliance consultants  \r

  * Banks or other financial institutions\r

  * Insurers and reinsurers and their claims agents and assessors  \r

  * Product providers; and\r

  * Mail houses.\r

  \r

  We are also permitted to collect and disclose your personal information when
  required or authorised to do so by law. To obtain a copy of our Privacy
  Policy, please contact us or visit www.walbrook.com.au. \r

  \r

  If you have concerns about the accuracy and completeness of the information
  we hold, you may request access to your data by contacting the Privacy Officer
  on +61 3 9013 6262.\r

  When your complaint is received, we will enter the details in our complaints
  register and investigate the circumstances. Within 30 days we must provide you
  with a written response to your complaint. \r

  \r

  The timeframe for a response may be extended under certain circumstances, in

  right to complain to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) if
  you are dissatisfied and the contact details for AFCA. \r

  not been resolved to your satisfaction, you can lodge a complaint with the

  ### What compensation arrangements are in place?\r

  \r

  In compliance with the requirements of section 912B of the Corporations Act
  2001, we have professional indemnity insurance in place in respect of
  financial services we provide to our clients. This insurance also covers
  claims concerning the conduct of representatives no longer working for us (but
  who did at the time of the relevant conduct). \r

  \r

  Please note that as Damien Crommie is the holder of a Certificate of Public
  Practice issued by Chartered Accountants Australia & New Zealand, liability is
  limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation.\r
