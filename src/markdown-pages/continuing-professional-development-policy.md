  ### Purpose


  This Continuing Professional Development (CPD) policy has been prepared and approved by Barbacane Advisors Pty Ltd trading as Walbrook Wealth Management (“Walbrook”)(ACN 626 694 139, AFSL512465) and must be made available to both Representatives and the public via the company website.


  The objective of this Policy is to ensure that Walbrook Representatives maintain professional knowledge and skills that enable them to provide high quality wealth management and personal financial advice services to Walbrook clients. It also serves to ensure that Walbrook and its Representatives meet the required standards as set out by the Financial Advisers Standards and Ethics Authority (FASEA) and prescribed by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and the Corporations (Relevant Providers Continuing Professional Development Standard) Determination 2018.


  Implementation of this policy will also ensure that Walbrook and its Relevant Providers act in accordance with the Financial Adviser Standards and Ethics Authority (FASEA) Code of Ethics and specifically Standard 10:


  “You must develop, maintain and apply a high level of relevant knowledge and skills.”


  ### Scope


  This policy applies to all Representatives (employees) of Walbrook. Where this policy refers to a Representative that is a Relevant Provider as defined by FASEA, reference will be made to Relevant Provider rather than Representative.


  ### CPD Year


  The Walbrook CPD year runs from 1 March to 28 February.


  ### Our approach to CPD


  Walbrook has a three-tier approach to CPD.


  ##### Tier 1 ‐ Representative led development


  Notwithstanding requirements under the Act, Walbrook expects Representatives to drive their development and continuing professional development. Also, our Representatives are expected, at all times, to ensure they meet or exceed the standards and requirements set out in their CPD Plans and the standards set by FASEA (where applicable). 


  ##### Tier 2 ‐ Guidance and monitoring by the Responsible Manager (RM)


  Representatives are guided on their development by the Responsible Manager (RM). This guidance will include a CPD Plan and ongoing coaching and supervision. 


  The RM monitors the completion of training, the progress towards meeting annual CPD requirements and reports to the Board regularly. 


  ##### Tier 3 ‐ Governance and accountability by the Board


  The Board provides a governance and supervision function by approving the CPD policy and reviewing CPD completion reports.


  ### Process for approving CPD activities & allocating CPD hours


  When a representative has completed or is contemplating a learning and development activity, they should forward details of the activity to the RM. The RM will then confirm whether the activity qualifies for CPD, for how many hours and in what specialist area.


  The RM will look for all of the following requirements of the Act to be satisfied when making this assessment:


  * the activity is in one of the defined CPD areas;

  * the activity has sufficient intellectual or practical content;

  * the activity primarily deals with matters related to the provision of financial product advice, financial advice services and financial advice business;

  * the activity is led or conducted by 1 or more persons who are appropriate, and have sufficient standing, expertise, academic qualifications and/or practical experience;

  * the activity is designed to enhance Relevant Providers’ knowledge and skills in areas that are relevant to the provision of financial product advice and financial advice services.


  The mechanism to be used for determining qualifying hours and specialist area is primarily reliance on the professional body or education provider that is providing the education. The RM may reduce (not increase) the number of hours credited.


  Where a third party has not opined, the RM will use their judgement to estimate the amount of time the learning and development activity will take to complete, and the specialist area or areas that are relevant.


  The RM will evidence this in their sign-off of the representative’s CPD Plan.


  ### Requirement for Annual CPD Plans


  Before the beginning of each CPD year (1 March), the RM sets tailored CPD targets for each representative, based upon assessment, review and individual development needs. The RM captures these targets and objectives in a CPD Plan. This Plan must be in place before the start of the CPD year.


  Where a representative commences their employment with Walbrook part way through the year, the RM calculates the required targets on a pro‐rata basis.


  Where the representative is a Relevant Provider, the CPD Plans are designed to meet or exceed standards set by the Financial Adviser Standards and Ethics Authority (FASEA).


  The CPD Plan is designed to maintain competency in the areas the Relevant Provider is qualified and licensed to provide Financial Advice. The RM approves the plan, which consists of no less than the minimum hours and knowledge areas required by FASEA.


  The minimum hours and knowledge areas are:


  * 40 hours of CPD each year, of which 70% will need to be approved by Walbrook.

  * Of the 40 hours, a minimum in each knowledge area outlined below.

    **Technical Competence (minimum 5 hours)** - The activity is designed to enhance participants’ technical proficiency and ability to develop and provide advice strategies that are appropriate to the objectives, financial situations and needs of different classes of retail clients. 

    **Client Care and Practice (minimum 5 hours)** - The activity is designed to enhance participants’ ability to act as a client-centric practitioner in advising retail clients. 

    **Regulatory Compliance and Consumer Protection (minimum 5 hours)** - The activity is designed to enhance participants’ understanding of applicable legal obligations and how to comply with them.  

    **Professionalism and Ethics (minimum 9 hours)** - The activity is designed to enhance participants’ capacity to act as an ethical professional. 

    **General (no minimum)** - The activity is designed to maintain and extend participants’ professional capabilities, knowledge and skills, including keeping up to date with regulatory, technical and other relevant developments, but is not in an area referred to in another item of this table. 

  A maximum of 4 hours professional reading time counts towards the 40 hours requirement.


  A maximum of 30 hours of formal relevant education provided by an education provider counts towards the 40 hours requirements, which may include any of the following:


  * a degree or equivalent qualification approved under the Corporations (Relevant Providers Degrees, Qualifications and Courses Standard) Determination 2018;

  * a course determined in a legislative instrument under paragraph 1546B(1)(b) of the Act e.g. a degree that an existing Relevant Provider would undertake to meet the new standards by 1 January 2024;

  * education or training provided or approved by a professional association;

  * formal education or training study towards qualifications or designations relevant to practice as a relevant provider.


  ### Organisational Training


  In addition to FASEA-relevant product training, general financial services training and industry development, Walbrook will provide training on the following areas:


  * Compliance & Quality Control Framework

  * Risk Management Framework

  * Dispute Resolution Procedures

  * Anti-Money Laundering Program

  * Advice Framework


  Representatives who are not Relevant Providers will also receive organisational training, and the Compliance & Quality Control Manager will maintain CPD Plans for them.


  ### Appropriate providers of CPD activities


  Activities that are assessed by Walbrook as qualifying for CPD should be provided by persons or entities that hold appropriate qualifications, accreditations and or practical experience, relevant to the training provided.


  In order to be applied to CPD Plans, CPD related activities must be provided by and/or accredited by a recognised industry provider such as the Financial Planning Association, Kaplan, or Chartered Accountants Australia & New Zealand.


  Independent providers must have relevant experience or education in the field in which they are training. They must declare the learning outcomes and be able to demonstrate how the content or training provided meets the learning outcomes. Walbrook will then determine if the training is appropriate for the Representatives CPD Plan.


  ### Considerations for Relevant Providers returning to work


  If a Relevant Provider has not been practising or authorised as a Relevant Provider for a continuous period of 2 years or more, the RM must take the following into account:


  * The Relevant Provider must not resume practice as a Relevant Provider of Walbrook unless Walbrook has approved the Relevant Provider’s CPD plan for the first CPD year after the Relevant Provider resumes practice.

  * Walbrook must not approve a CPD plan under this section unless satisfied that it is appropriate to address gaps in the Relevant Provider’s competence, knowledge and skills arising from the Relevant Provider’s absence from practice.


  ### Evidencing outcomes of CPD


  Where available, the Relevant Provider must obtain written confirmation from the training provider, which indicates the training provider, activities undertaken, learning outcomes, the knowledge area and applicable CPD hours. Where the training provider has not noted learning outcomes on the confirmation, these should be included by the Relevant Provider in their own words in the Kaplan OnTrack system. 


  ### Record keeping


  The Responsible Manager is responsible for ensuring that Walbrook adequately trains its Relevant Providers. Under the changes introduced by FASEA, evidence of CPD completion is required to be maintained by the Relevant Provider or Walbrook for approved CPD.


  Walbrook determines the appropriate form of evidence to be retained at the time of accreditation of the CPD by Walbrook. At a minimum, it should evidence:


  * Activities undertaken

  * Proof of completion

  * Learning outcomes obtained


  If a Relevant Provider leaves Walbrook, the Relevant Provider will be entitled to a copy of their register entries to ensure continuity.


  Walbrook must keep the training records for seven years.


  ### Checking Compliance with this Policy


  Walbrook monitors progress towards the completion of CPD Plans every month. Representatives must record all CPD activities that count towards the CPD Plan, as they are completed.


  CPD records will be checked on an annual basis by Walbrook. The check will use a 100% sample size and seek to confirm that each entry has appropriate evidence and that evidence supports the knowledge areas indicated.


  ### Publication


  Walbrook must publish this Policy on the Walbrook website.


  ### Implementation Date


  This version 1.20 is approved for publication on 30 October 2019.


  Last review date: 16 October 2020.
