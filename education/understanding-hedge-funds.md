## What are Hedge Funds?

Hedge funds are actively managed investment funds that seek to generate returns that utilise non-traditional investment strategies or asset classes.

Hedge fund investment objectives vary from fund to fund, with strategies typically unconstrained by benchmarks.  A key aspect is that hedge funds concentrate on generating returns independently of the market environment – they are thus an alternative investment and have a low correlation with traditional investment categories.

Since they are less regulated than traditional funds, hedge funds are flexible. They use advanced techniques such as short selling, leveraging, hedging and are using higher proportions of derivatives and structured products to achieve their investment goals.

While hedge funds have traditionally been associated with offshore jurisdictions and low levels of regulation and oversight, following the Global Financial Crisis some hedge fund strategies are now available in more traditional fund structures and jurisdictions.

### Common Hedge Fund Strategies

The actual risks that a hedge fund takes vary widely and depend on the strategy the fund uses and the financial instruments/techniques that are applied within that strategy.

Equity Hedge or Long/Short Equity and certain Event Driven strategies tend to be more correlated with risky assets while Global Macro and CTAs show lower correlations (positive in bull markets and low to negative in bear markets). Relative value is quite uncorrelated but prone to higher stress correlations during liquidity events.

In order of lower to higher expected return/volatility:

1. Relative Value (RV)
2. Event-Driven
3. Long / Short Equity
4. Global Macro
5. Commodity - Trading Advisors (CTA)

#### Relative Value

Profits are realised based on price differences between markets and not on a market expectation itself. 

There are four main types:

* Convertible arbitrage, where the manager takes advantage of the price difference between an implicit option with the underlying value.
* Fixed-income arbitrage, where the manager takes advantage of price differences between fixed income instruments
* Capital structure arbitrage, where the manager takes advantage of differences between assets and foreign capital of a company
* Equity market neutral where the manager uses differences in stock price by balance long and short positions in market sectors.

#### Event - Driven

Profits are realised by stock price fluctuations caused by single events in a company’s lifecycle. 

There are three main types:

* Merger arbitrage - takeover or merger of companies
* distressed securities - companies in challenging situations
* Special situations - special situations such as spin-offs or buyouts

#### Long / Short Equity

The fund invests according to its expectations of the future development of stock prices. This strategy is therefore a directional approach. 

There are three main types:

* Equity-hedge - The equity portfolio is hedged using options/derivatives.
* Equity non-hedge - Similar to common investment funds but managers can make use of external financing (leverage).
* Short selling - Incorporates an opportunity for the fund manager to make investments on falling market expectations.

#### Global Macro

Investments based on the early detection of macro-economic events such as over or underestimation of exchange/interest rates.

Fund managers invest in different markets such as currencies or commodities using a wide range of financial instruments (e.g. futures, options).

#### Commodity-Trading Advisors (CTA)

CTA hedge funds trade exchange-traded futures contracts on a variety of underlying assets including commodities, equities, and currencies as well as indices and interest rates. Due to their high activity level, CTA strategies are also known as 'managed futures' strategies.

CTA trading may be systematic (based on pre-set rules to anticipate future price movements) or discretionary (investment decision based on the discretion and expertise of the manager)

### Common Hedge Fund Structures

There are different possibilities for investing in hedge funds.

1. Direct investment in offshore hedge fund
2. Direct investment in locally registered hedge fund
3. Investment in exchange traded hedge fund
4. Investment in fund of hedge funds

#### Direct investment in offshore hedge fund

Professional/institutional/accredited or qualified investors can invest directly in the fund. The sale of off-shore funds is often restricted or prohibited. Investing in offshore companies may have an impact on the taxation of the investment.

Offshore hedge funds are private investment partnerships which only accept professional, institutional, accredited or qualified investors. They require a minimum investment volume and a minimum investment period.

#### Direct investment in locally registered hedge fund

If registered and approved by the local regulator, such funds can be sold to the public.

#### Investment in exchange traded hedge fund

Some hedge funds are listed on a securities exchange. This can result in a larger correlation of the funds with stock markets. Exchange-traded hedge funds may be sold at a premium/discount.

#### Investment in fund of hedge funds

The manager of a fund of fund pools the capital of multiple investors to build a portfolio of Hedge Funds.

This lowers the minimum amount required for investment, increases diversification, reducing the risks involved in investment and manager selection, but adds a layer of fees and complexity.

## Key features of Hedge Funds

### Investment Horizon

Long-Term

### Return Expectation

Predominantly capital gain.

### Market Expectation

Independent of market expectations e.g rising, falling or trading sideways.  Some strategies benefit from high volatility environment.

### Maximum Gain

The maximum gain is unlimited, comprised predominantly of capital gains.

#### Maximum Loss

Total loss of capital invested.

### Profit / Loss

Timing and quantum of returns are dependent on hedge fund manager and strategy employed, though typically independent of movements in liquid equity and bond markets.

Returns typically driven by absolute return objectives (no benchmarking).

### Trading Process

An investor in a fund or fund of funds will typically invest via a private bank or financial advisor, who will prepare the application forms and liaise with the fund manager on their behalf.

### Trading Costs

Investing in and selling private equity funds create explicit and implicit costs for the investor. Private banks and financial advisers charge transaction fees for arranging the application and providing regular updates.

The fund manager will typically charge a management fee of 1.00 - 2.00% pa, with performance fees of 15% - 20% charged. 

## Advantages & Disadvantages

### Advantages

* Returns are not typically closely correlated with traditional asset classes, providing a diversification benefit to portfolios
* May allow for participation in markets that are difficult to access via traditional financial instruments.
* Participation in markets and instruments not available to traditional financial instruments.
* Participation in market environments where
  traditional instruments offer few opportunities.
* Professional management with performance
  incentives.
* Reduced portfolio volatility.
* Opportunities for high returns at the expense of
  using high-risk investment instruments.

### Disadvantages

* The investments are less liquid than traditional instruments. 
* Shares are redeemed at specific intervals/times only and may be subject to a notice period.
* Being less regulated, hedge funds are not forced to disclose their portfolio holdings and strategies in the same way as mutual funds.
* Minimum investment period (lock-up period)
* Usually not listed/illiquid participation
* Price uncertainty: limited regulations concerning the calculation and publication of NAV.
* Only accessible for professional/institutional/
  qualified investors.
* Largely unregulated
* Lack of control: the fund manager has absolute
  trading authority.
* As they are less regulated, hedge funds may not need to disclose their portfolio composition and
  risks. The investor therefore has less information to help him judge the risks.

## Risks

#### Liquidity Risk

The risk that an investor cannot sell an investment at a fair price within an expected timeframe is called Liquidity Risk.

Liquidity risk is even more prevalent in alternative investments such as hedge funds, where redemption may only be possible with advance notice and at specified dates, and the underlying assets may themselves be illiquid.

Minimum holding periods may apply. A hedge fund is not necessarily listed and tradable on the secondary market.

#### Manager Risk

Manager Risk is the risk that an investment manager or investment management team fail to meet their investment objectives or drifts from their stated investment mandate or style.

#### Operational Risk

As a result of reduced regulation and low levels of transparency, the operational risks and fraud risks are higher than with traditional funds.

#### **Market Risk**

The investor is exposed to the general economic environment, e.g. interest rate changes, exchange rates (when not denominated in home currency). The psychology of the market participants tends to enforce trends, and in a market of expectations, not all expectations may be rational.

Hedge funds aim at absolute returns independently of the market environment, investing in a variety of instruments and making use of derivatives and advanced techniques such as short sales and leverage. 

Therefore, the degree of risk is driven by the
investment strategy and the risk return profile of the fund.

#### **Currency Risk**

The investor may be exposed to currency risk, because the product or underlying of the product
is denominated in other currencies than that of the country in which the investor is resident.

#### Legal and Regulatory Risks

Participation in offshore investment vehicles may be restricted by local legislation, and may also influence the taxation of hedge fund investments.
