**What are Transition to Retirement Pensions?**

A transition to retirement pension is a form of account-based pension, available to pensioners who have reached retirement age but have not yet met a condition of release.

Once you contribute money to superannuation you have to meet strict conditions to access your retirement savings. Generally, you have to wait until you are fully retired or reach age 65. However, there is another option - you can continue to work possibly in a reduced capacity (less hours) and access your superannuation in the form of a pension. This is known as a Transition to Retirement pension (TTR).

The transition to retirement scheme offers incentives for older workers to remain in the workforce for longer than originally planned. It can also prolong superannuation savings. If you find yourself weighting up whether it's time to retire from the workforce altogether, this could be the perfect way to have a trial run.

If you are aged 55 or older, you can start a TTR pension to supplement your salary while you continue to work. This could, for example allow you to reduce your hours of work or take on a lower paid job with less responsibility. Of course, you can continue to work full time if you prefer.

The main advantage of a TTR pension is the potential Tax saving it offers. Quite simply, the income received is taxed concessionally for those under the age of 60 or could be tax-free from the age of 60.

You can combine the TTR pension with salary sacrifice contributions in to superannuation which may boost your tax savings even further. Instead of paying your marginal rate of tax (can be up to 46.5%) on your salary, you can salary sacrifice a portion and only pay 15% tax on the contribution to superannuation. The income from the pension can replace your reduced salary. This means you may be able to receive the same, if not more income than before due to the savings.

The combination of a TTR pension and salary sacrifice arrangement is best suited if you:

* Are age 55 or more,

  Are working full-time, and

  Have some superannuation savings already.

A couple of points you need to be aware of regarding TTR pension:

* You can select a pension between a set minimum and maximum limit each year,
* Pension payments are paid tax-free if you are age 60 or over or concessional taxed if aged between 55 and 60 (a portion of your pension payments may be tax-free, and you may be eligible for a tax offset),
* You cannot make lump sum withdrawals from the pension (unless you fully retire or reach age 65),
* Tax on investment earnings is capped at 15%,
* You can stop the pension at any time and your money will be â€˜rolled' backed to superannuation,
* Centrelink will include the account balance of the TTR pension and a portion of the pension payments in assessing your eligibility for age pension (if applicable).

Let's look at transition to retirement in action.

Example 1 - transition to retirement

Mel, a widow (age 60) wants to reduce her working hours and decides to work three days a week instead of five days. She plans to continue working in to her 60s. She is concerned about how she will manage on a reduce income.

Mel already has $250,000 in superannuation and is currently on a full-time salary of $60,000 (net income $48,000) plus 9% employer super contributions ($5,400). Her salary has reduced to $30,000 ($27,950 net) once she goes part-time. Mel believes she now only requires net income of $38,000 as her mortgage is paid off and her kids have left home.

Mel decides to commence a TTR pension paying $10,000 per annum to supplement her income, giving her total net income of approximately $38,000.

By using a TTR pension Mel can reduce her hours of work and supplement her income with the pension.

Example 2 - transition to retirement and salary sacrifice

James (age 57) is working full time and is on a salary of $80,000. James wants to maintain his lifestyle, save on tax and build his superannuation before his planned retirement at age 65.

James has $300,000 in superannuation.

James decides to commence a TTR pension with $250,000 and salary sacrifices some of his income. If James salary sacrifices $15,000 and draws $12,500 per annum from his TTR pension, he will have around the same net income. He will save $50,764 in tax and have $48,224 more in superannuation by the time he is age 67.

As salary sacrifice uses pre-tax dollars, James can actually contribute more to superannuation than he withdraws, without affecting his cash flow or lifestyle, but reducing his tax payable.

[Summary](<>)

A TTR pension combined with salary sacrifice can be a tax-effective way to boost your superannuation savings. We recommend you see a financial adviser to help you decide of the TTR pension strategy option is right for you.

## Risks of Account Based Pensions

**Taxation and Legislative Risk**

Our information is based on legislative practices of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and other relevant government bodies as they presently exist. As with most financially related matters, there is always a legislative risk that provisions may be amended.

**Market Risk**

An account-based pension may contain a mix of cash, capital stable, diversified and specialist fund. The value of units in each fund may rise and fall, in line with the value of underlying assets as determined by market conditions.

**Longevity Risk**

Account-based pensions do not guarantee your pension payments will last throughout your lifetime. Essentially, the longevity of your account-based pension is determined by your investment earnings, which are determined by your investment strategy, the income you draw and any lump sum withdrawals you may make. Payments will only continue while there is a balance in the account

#### Centrelink Treatment

Account-based pensions are assessed under the deeming rules for the purposes of the Centrelink income test. This means the income assessment is calculated using an assumed rate of return (set by the government) against your account balance.

However, if you commenced your account-based pension before 1 January 2015 and have been continuously receiving a means-tested payment from Centrelink or Veterans' Affairs (DVA) since 31 December 2014 your account-based pension may continue to be assessed under the previous rules. These rules may be more favourable for you as they only assess a portion of the income payments received. If you switch to a new pension provider or your Centrelink/DVA entitlements reduce to nil your account-based pension will convert to the deeming rules.

Regardless of when your account-based pension commenced, lump sums withdrawn do not count as income for Centrelink/DVA purposes but under the deductible rules these withdrawals reduce how much of each income payment is not assessable going forward.

The full account balance of an account-based pension is counted as an assessable asset.
