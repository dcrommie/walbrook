# **What is Foreign Exchange?**

Foreign exchange involves the exchange of two different currencies. Since specific precious metals, such as gold, share similar properties, such as availability, they are included on the foreign exchange market and traded in the same way.

## **Key Features of Foreign Exchange Markets**

The foreign exchange market is the largest available financial market worldwide.

* Liquidity and traded volumes are extremely high.

  The only market in the world which is open 24 hours a day.

  Volatility can be substantial.

For reasons of demand, liquidity and availability, precious metals and precious metal accounts are included in the foreign exchange market.

Foreign exchange trades presuppose that currencies are freely tradable. This is not the case for all currencies. The currency traffic is regulated by the authorities, and the way they manage exchange rates is called a ‘regime’.

Examples for exchange rate regimes are:

* Free float - the exchange rate is determined by supply and demand, and may be managed by the central bank to avoid excessive appreciation/depreciation.
* Pegged - fixed to a specific value or floating within a band.

For an investor, this may mean that certain currencies are not freely available or are traded at exchange rates that do not reflect actual market conditions. Policies may be changed by the authorities at any time.

Returns on the foreign exchange market are realised by fluctuations in the exchange rate with time, adjusted for interest rate differentials.

\
• The costs of the trade are mainly the bid/ask-spread. This spread is typically lower for foreign exchange than other financial instruments and may depend on the volume of the trade.

The bid-ask spread: orders (interests) to buy are left in the market and sellers can trade on them: the best bid will be the highest available price. The best offer will be the lowest price buyers can find among orders (interests) left in the market by sellers. The difference is called a bid-ask spread.

Investment Horizon: Short-Term

Income Expectation: Capital Gain

Market Expectation: Suitable for rising and falling markets

Maximum Gain: Unlimited - the difference between market value at buying and market value when selling

Maximum Loss: There is a risk of unlimited loss

Profit / Loss: Not predictable. The return behaves linear with the changing exchange rates, unless options are used. Trading can involve access to significant leverage, which can magnify gains, losses and volatility.

**Spot and Forward Foreign Exchange Rates**

An exchange rate (forex rate) is the rate at which one currency can be converted to another.

This depends on a variety of factors such as:

* interest and inflation rates
* political stability
* transparency of the country’s economic and political decisions
* general economic welfare.

Considering foreign exchange transactions, two types of exchange rates exist:

Spot Rate

The current (today) exchange rate for standard settlement of the transaction

Forward Rates

The exchange rate applicable at a certain date in the future. Forward rates are based on the spot rate, adjusted by the interest rate differential between the two currencies.

**Types of Foreign Exchange Transactions**

There are two major types of foreign exchange transactions.

FX Spot Transactions

FX Forward Transactions

A spot transaction is the purchase or sale of a currency at the current ('today') rate (spot rate) for standard settlement.

Spot settlement for major currency pairs is the trade date plus two business days.

Transactions require full coverage of the nominal value, therefore there is no need for margin.

A forward transaction is an agreement for a currency trade with a settlement date in the future.

The amount can be fixed freely, wtith maturity from three working days up to 5 years, and the counterparty will require collateral.

The contract may not be terminated early however an exposure can be cleared during its lifetime by a countertransaction for the same maturity date.

Other forward products such as options carry an expanded set of features and risks and require additional knowledge of derivative instruments.

Some forward products, such as outrights, swaps and options, are traded over the counter and are highly customisable in terms of maturity and size. Others, such as futures, options and warrants, are exchange traded and standardised.

Forward Products

Over the counter (OTC)

Customisable maturity and size

* Outrights
* Swaps
* OTC Options

Exchange Traded

Standardised contracts & products

* Futures
* Options
* Warrants

Advantages and Disadvantages

Currencies are often not only traded on the spot markets and exchange rates serve as underlying for a wide variety of other financial instruments, such as mutual funds, futures, derivatives. Such instruments bear risks above and beyond the direct buying/selling of currencies and require corresponding investor knowledge.

Advantages

* Liquidity - the foreign exchange market is the biggest liquid market in the world, and is open 24 hours a day, 5 days a week.
* Volume - high volumes can be traded without influencing prices
* Transaction Costs - the spread between bids and offers is low
* Margin - there are low margin requirements and fewer limitations when compared with futures
* Hedging - movements are easily hedged using forwards or options

Disadvantages

* Due to availability and dynamics, constant attention is needed
* Leverage and margin maximise profits but possible losses as well
* Spreads for retail clients are generally much higher than for retail clients
* The market can be opaque for retail clients
* Interventions by central banks
* FX rates are volatile

Risks

Market Risks

Exchange rates change as a result of many factors. Besides the normal forces of supply and demand, there is also country risk. Country risk is the risk of political and economic changes in the currency's home country or changes in the exchange policy of that country.

Agreements about currency trades in the future at an exchange rate fixed today also include further risks.

Credit Risk

The ability of the counterparty to fulfil its obligations is an important consideration.

Liquidity Risk

The contract may be closed out before the settlement date using a counter deal. During the life of the contract, investor liquidity will be bound for the requested margin.

Currencies on the spot market require full coverage of the nominal value. Outright transactions are usually not exchanged at the face value – so-called margins and financial leverage apply:

* When executing a trade, an initial deposit (a margin) is required which is usually lower than the nominal value of the trade– the margin can be for example as low as 10% of the face value. The possibility to trade high volumes based on a minimum initial amount is called financial leverage.

  Margin requirements may change according to exchange rate fluctuations. This may necessitate further collateral be added to the initial margin provided (so-called ‘margin calls’).

  Leverage maximises not only possible profits but also possible losses. It contributes very significantly to the risks involved.

#### Non-Deliverable Forwards

Forwards on currencies are often used as a hedge against the volatility of currency exchange rates\
• Non-deliverable forwards are currency forwards that involve

One freely obtainable currency (e.g. USD) and,\
A currency which is not freely obtainable, thinly traded or on which forward trades have been banned (thus are\
non-deliverable)

\
• The trade is defined by:\
A notional amount\
The non-deliverable forward rate: actually the estimated forward rate of the non-deliverable currency\
A fixing and settlement date\
The non-deliverable forward is traded over the counter and always settled in cash as a difference between the actual spot rate at fixing date and the non-deliverable forward rate
