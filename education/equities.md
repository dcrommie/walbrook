## What are equities?

The term ‘equity’ refers to the residual value of a company after deducting all liabilities from the company’s assets.

Equities are any security that claims participation in the ownership of a company, with the most common being the ‘ordinary share’.

The equity investor in a company, known as a shareholder, participates in the economic success of a company, receiving income in the form of company dividends paid from net profits after tax, and potentially capital growth in the value of the shares.

A dividend is the distribution of a part of the company’s income to its shareholders. The board of directors decides on an actual payment and the amount after deciding about other necessities (e.g. investments, reserves). Dividends can take the form of cash payments or additional shares.

The intrinsic value of a share is therefore determined by the performance (and performance expectation) of the company and by extension, its competitors and the broader market environment, e.g. economic conditions.

A shareholder will typically have a right to vote, in proportion to their shareholding, at general and extraordinary meetings of the company. They do not have access to internal information, e.g. current financial situation, strategic decisions unless they are also a director or employee or the company.

## **Key Features of Equities**

Investment in Equities may be suitable for investors with a time horizon greater than five years, who are primarily seeking capital gains, with some income.

When contemplating an investment in Equities, investors should consider the following key features in light of their investment needs.

#### **Investment Horizon**

Medium – Long Term

#### **Return Expectation**

Predominantly Capital Gain, with the potential for Dividend Income.

#### **Market Expectation**

Suitable for expectations of rising markets. There are trading strategies that cater to other market expectations, e.g. short selling, which has a riskier return profile.

#### **Maximum Gain**

The maximum gain is unlimited, comprised of capital gains and income.

#### **Maximum Loss**

In the case of fully paid ordinary shares, the maximum possible loss is that of the capital invested with an insolvent company or companies.

#### **Profit / Loss**

Equities are typically perpetual investments with no set maturity date, and returns are dependent on multiple variables, making them more volatile than other investments.

#### **Trading Process**

When placing an order, the price at the exact time of execution is unknown, as there is a time delay between the placement and execution of an order.

To manage this, investors may provide other instructions when placing orders, such as requesting specific place or time of execution, a limit to the buy/sell price (known as a limit order) or execution at the best available price for the transaction size (known as a market order).

#### **Trading Costs**

Buying and selling equities create explicit and implicit costs for the investor. Brokers and banks charge transaction fees for their services depending on the type of asset, the market place and transaction volume. Minimum fees per transactions can apply. The exchange may also charge a commission, and in some countries, governments add stamp duties or other taxes to the total cost.

Investors should also be mindful of implicit costs, mainly bid/offer spreads, on both the traded equity and any associated currency conversions. The bid/offer spread is the gap between the highest price a buyer is willing to buy a security and the lowest price that a seller is willing to sell that same security. A spread is wide (large) or narrow (small) and is a reflection of liquidity in the market for a particular security.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

#### **Advantages**

* Cost-effective to trade and hold
* Obtain direct participation in the financial performance of a company
* Possibility of both income and capital growth
* Historic long-term outperformance when compared with the other main asset classes

#### **Disadvantages**

* Volatility, with fluctuations in capital value and income much higher than other key asset classes
* Shareholders rank behind other creditors in a liquidation

## **Risks**

When considering equity investment, investors evaluate two main risk factors: the economic environment (market risk) and the company itself (company risk).

#### **Market Risk**

The investor is exposed to the general economic environment, e.g. interest rate changes, exchange rates (when not denominated in home currency). The psychology of the market participants tends to enforce trends, and in a market of expectations, not all expectations may be rational.

#### **Company Risk**

Company risk stems from the economic situation or environment specific to the company, including the quality of the company, its management and its competitors.

Company risk is an unsystematic risk, meaning that an investor can reduce its impact on a portfolio basis by including exposure to other companies, sectors and countries in your portfolio.
