### Asset Class Overview

An asset class is a group of securities which exhibit similar characteristics and market behaviour. Below is a brief description of the major asset classes.

#### Cash, Deposits & Money Market Instruments

Cash generally refers to investments in bank bills and similar securities with short investment time-frames. They provide stable, low-risk income in the form of regular interest payments.

Credit quality refers to an entity's ability to repay debt. The safety of a cash deposit is linked to the financial strength of the deposit bank. The credit quality of that institution, as judged by ratings given to it by rating agencies such as Standard & Poors (S&P), Fitch, and Moody's are good indicators. Still, the actual credit quality may not necessarily be as high in practice.

An investor can decrease the risk of holding cash by diversifying the cash allocation across multiple issuers and investing in 'cash equivalents'.

Money market funds are collective investment schemes which invest money in cash or cash equivalents with high credit quality. These typically include U.S. Government Treasury Bills, bank certificates of deposit, bankers' accept­ances, corporate commercial paper, and other money market instruments.

By investing in cash equivalents issued by a broad range of issuers, these funds allow investors to diversify their allocation to the cash asset class away from concentrated exposure to a small number of institutions.

#### Fixed Income

The fixed income asset class encompasses investments in which an investor lends money to a government or company for a defined period of time in return for regular payments based on fixed or floating (variable) interest rates.

The most common type of fixed income instrument is the bond, but hybrid securities, asset-backed securities (ABS), commercial loan obligations (CLO), mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and floating-rate notes (FRN) are also common.

Bonds are a source of regular income, as their returns are more predictable than other investments. The downside is that returns tend to be lower than those of other asset classes, especially over the long term, and they do not protect the investor's capital from inflation.

Bonds have a nominal or par value, typically 100, which is the sum that will be returned to the investor at maturity. Except in the case of inflation-linked bonds, known as 'linkers', the par value is not adjusted for inflation. While the market price of a bond fluctuates with interest rates, inflation expectations and the credit quality of the issuer, as the bond approaches maturity it tends to converge towards its par value.

While bonds are generally viewed as lower risk than equities, they are not risk-free.

Bonds that pay a fixed rate of interest are subject to interest rate risk. As market interest rates rise, the value of a fixed rate bond tends to fall, meaning that the yield on that bond rises in line with the market.

To understand how sensitive a bond is to movements in market interest rates, we use a measure called 'duration'. Expressed in years, duration is affected by the amount of time to maturity, as well as the amount of income that the bond pays. The higher a bond's duration, the greater it's sensitivity to interest rate movement.

The investor is also exposed to Credit Default Risk, which is the risk that the issuer of the bond will not make the interest payments and repay the full par value of the bond at maturity. This risk is reflected by the market in a credit 'spread', which is the additional yield that the market (investors) requires above government bond rates of the same maturity.

While investors can invest directly in bonds, a common way to access this asset class is via collective investment schemes such as ETF's, managed funds, investment trusts or listed investment companies. Managers of these funds can invest in many different types of bonds, across a wide spectrum of issues, countries, sectors and duration, and incorporate currency hedging strategies.

Investing via a collective investment allows investors to diversify away a significant amount of risk and opportunity cost involved in having a concentrated bond portfolio of bonds issued in one jurisdiction and in one currency.

#### Equities

Equities, also known as stocks or shares, are units of ownership in a company. When investors buy the shares of a company, they own part of the company and become its shareholders.

Equities provide an investor with the potential for capital growth and income. On the downside, share prices tend to fluctuate more than other asset classes.

In contrast to bonds, which generally pay a fixed rate of return, returns to shareholders are highly variable. This is true of both the regular income, in the form of dividends, and the amount and timing of the return of the investors capital. Both income and capital returns from shares are linked to the fortunes of the company and can be expected to increase in line with profitability and free cash flow.

Capital returns are also highly dependent on the market price at the time the investor sells their shares. The market price of a share is affected by supply and demand, which is influ­enced by the market assessment of:

* **Company-specific factors** - such as the quality of the company's management, its profitability, the strength of balance sheet, and competition within its sector.
* **Sector-specific factors** - such as the demand for a company's products, commodity prices, and changes in technology;
* **Macroeconomic factors** - such as the strength of the local and global economy, exchange rate movements and interest rates.

Investors can invest in shares directly, or via collective investment schemes such as investment trusts or investment companies, commonly known as ETFs, managed funds or mutual funds. Managers of these funds can invest in many different types of bonds, across a wide spectrum of issues, countries, sectors and duration, and incorporate currency hedging strategies.

#### Alternative Investments

Alternative Investments are usually considered more complex investments when compared to cash, fixed income and equities, as they expose investors to additional risks that need to be considered before making an investment.

**Property**

An alternative to investing in property directly is to gain exposure via financial instruments.

Property securities are fractional interests companies or trusts that own commercial, retail, industrial or residential property. These companies or trusts may be listed on a stock exchange, but it is common for them to be unlisted.

The most common form is the Real Estate Investment Trust or 'REIT'. An equity REIT purchases properties with the aim of generating rental income and capital growth. A mortgage REIT does not purchase properties, it invests in mortgages and collects interest income.

As with investing in property directly, the risks involved include the risks posed by rising interest rates, tenants defaulting on rental payments and maintenance costs being higher than anticipated. Property securities can be illiquid, and it may be challenging to find a buyer for your units when you wish to sell, particularly if the vehicle is unlisted. Exposure to construction or development activities, via equity or debt, also increases the risk profile.

Property vehicles are often geared, which means that if property values fall or the company cannot refinancing their existing loans, the company may call for more capital or default on their loans, causing loss of your investment.

**Commodities**

Commodities are 'consistent' assets that do not vary to a large degree from producer to producer. They conform to a standard measurement and grade of quality - for example, a barrel of oil or a tonne of iron ore.

Trading of commodity contracts is carried out in futures exchanges, with the value of a contract determined by supply and demand for that commodity, along with interest rates and the cost of storage for the period between trade date and settlement date.

Prices can be volatile and fluctuate sub­stantially if a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, affects their supply or production.

Gold and other precious metals are seen as a store of value and are often viewed as safe havens during times of crisis or uncertainty.

**Hedge Funds**

Hedge funds are collective investment schemes that aim to generate returns that are uncorrelated to traditional asset classes.

Traditionally, hedge funds were domiciled in offshore jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands, with limited liquidity and relatively high fees. Open to sophisticated investors only, they were typically unconstrained in their choice of assets, markets and trading style, with a view to maximising returns by responding to a broad range of conditions in a broad range of markets.

Since the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, where many offshore hedge funds either blew up or restricted redemptions, the use of hedge fund strategies in highly regulated jurisdictions has gained popularity.

Typically known as absolute return funds, the hedge fund managers still have a flexible investment mandate, but are restricted by minimum requirements for liquidity, leverage and counterparty risk management.

Hedge Funds commonly use derivatives for leveraging returns and engage in practices such as 'shorting', where the potential for loss is theoretically unlimited. 'Shorting' involves borrowing a security and selling it in the expecta­tion that it will fall in value, at which point you buy it in the market and return it to the lender.

As well as the risks posed by leverage and shorting, given the unconstrained nature of most hedge fund strategies, Manager Risk is a key risk to consider when investing in hedge funds.

For more information, refer to **[Understanding Hedge Funds](https://walbrook.com.au/understanding-hedge-funds)**.

**Private Equity Funds**

Private Equity (PE) funds are unregulated collective investment schemes that typically invest in private companies.

Investment in PE funds is typically by way of commitment, whereby an investor agrees to invest a certain amount in the fund and this amount is drawn down by the fund when it is needed to make investments.

PE funds tend to be closed-ended and have finite lifespans, typically 5-7 years with the option of one or two 2-year extensions. During the life of the fund, it is usually not possible for investors to redeem their money, meaning that it can be several years before investors realise a return on their investment. For this lack of liquidity, PE investors typically expect a higher return.

Returns are dependent on the perfor­mance of the companies in which the fund invests, and therefore are largely dependent on the fund manager's skill at securities selection. Leverage is often used by the PE fund to acquire portfolio companies, which increases the risk of the investment.

Whilst returns may be higher than other investments, investment in PE funds involve a high degree of risk and are only suitable for investors who fully understand and are willing to take on those risks, including the lack of liquidity.

**Alternative investments often perform differently from traditional assets such as equities and fixed income and can be used to diversify your portfolio.**

### **Common financial instrumen**ts

**Some financial products are not considered asset classes in their own right but facilitate investment or incorporate asset classes in a complex and combined structure. These products are generally known as financial instruments.**

#### Foreign Exchange

Foreign exchange trading - buying one currency in exchange for another - serves three main purposes.

1. It facilitates the settlement of investments in foreign currencies
2. It helps to manage risk by allowing investors to hedge their foreign currency exposures arising from foreign investments.
3. It allows traders to speculate on exchange rates and interest rate differentials, with the aim of making capital gains.

Speculative foreign exchange trading exposes investors to Foreign Exchange Risk, as desired, which can be volatile and driven by a variety of economic factors. This risk may be magnified by the use of leverage, in the form of foreign exchange options, forwards or futures.

#### Derivatives

Derivatives are financial instruments whose price is derived from an underlying asset or instrument. Examples of derivatives include options, futures, forwards, warrants, options and swaps.

Although some investors buy derivatives in order to speculate, they are generally used to manage risk, which is known as hedging. For example, an investor buying foreign shares is exposed to adverse currency movements. To hedge this risk, they could sell that currency forward, against their home currency, to secure a specified exchange rate.

While hedging reduces the investor's risk, their potential return is usually reduced by the cost of the hedge.

For more information, refer to **[Understanding Derivatives](https://walbrook.com.au/understanding-derivatives)**.

#### Structured Products

The term structured product is used for a wide variety of financial products, that are structured by financial institutions to offer return profiles that differ from traditional asset classes.

In most cases, the structured product is comprised of a debt instrument and one or more derivatives. The investment term is fixed, with the potential for early redemption or cancellation if certain triggers are met, and might be designed to provide income, capital growth or both.

A common example is the capital protected note. For example, an investor would like to buy $100K of BHP but wants to protect their downside risk. They could just buy an at-the-money BHP call option for their desired investment term (5 years), paying the premium upfront.

Alternatively, a bank will build a structured product. The client will pay the bank $100K, and the bank will issue a zero coupon bond. The price of the zero-coupon bond is $90, and it will return $100 to the investor in 2 years time. This leaves $10 available for the 2 year at-the-money BHP call option (and the bank's fee). In 2 years time, the investor receives the $100 back, plus the return on the option.

The risks of Structured Products vary greatly, depending on the type of payoff and the underlying, however, the most important risk to consider is Issuer Risk. In the example used above, the investor's money is invested with the Bank, not BHP. If the Bank fails, the investor will likely not receive their money back.
