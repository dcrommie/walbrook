**We are committed to providing you with financial advice tailored to your needs, requirements, objectives, and degree of investment experience. Whatever the extent of your prior experience of financial products and markets, we strongly recommend you familiarise yourself with the explanatory material provided in this document.**

**What is your Investment Profile?**

It is fundamental to the quality and relevance of our advice that we have a common and in-depth understanding of your financial position and your expectations of the advice that we give you. Much of this information is captured in the Client Investment Profile form which is completed when you open an account with us.

We regularly check that your Client Investment Profile is up to date to ensure that we continue to serve you in your best interests, and that we keep abreast of any changes that may have a bearing on the advice that we provide.

Below are descriptions of each of our investment profiles. The profiles have three components: an Investment Objective, a Risk Profile and an Investment Strategy. Please let us know if you have any questions about these and if there are any changes to your financial goals or circumstances that may impact your investment profile and the advice that we provide. You should bear in mind that certain mandates and products that we offer may, because of their particular nature, have their own distinctive investment objectives and risk characteristics which do not precisely correlate with those set out below.

You should always read the specific mandate and product documentation to gain a proper understanding of the unique investment objectives and associated risks. You should also take into account that each mandate or product may not individually correlate with your Client Investment Profile, but when they are considered together, along with any other assets that you have told us about, the overall result should correlate with your Client Investment Profile.

### Primary Investment Objective

Our understanding of your intentions and goals for your investments. Supplementary cash flow generation - You can choose cash flow generation as a supplementary objective to be combined with your primary objective of 'capital preservation' or 'dynamic growth'. With this supplementary objective you want to achieve regular income from interest and dividend earnings.

#### Capital preservation

You want to preserve your capital with the least possible potential risk to your capital. ThereÂ­fore you want to invest in instruments of a minimal risk type and/or high liquidity, recognising that there is a very limited potential of growth and income earnings.

#### Balanced growth

You want to achieve regular income from interest and dividend earnings. You therefore prefer to invest in instruments of a minimal to medium risk:type, recognising that there may be only limited growth potential. You are willing to absorb some risk of potential loss to your capital.

#### Dynamic Growth

You want to grow the value of your investments and accumulate wealth over time through price appreciation. You therefore prefer to invest in instruments of a medium to higher risk type, recognising that the potential to accumulate wealth is much greater. You are willing to accept more risk, short-term loss of a higher magnitude and greater variance in the year-on-year results to achieve above average growth.

### Overall Risk Profile

Our understanding of your ability to bear the financial risks of your investments, and your willingness to accept fluctuations in your investments over time.

#### Low

You are willing and able to take only small risks resulting in almost no capital losses. You will only accept low fluctuations in the value of your investment. You prefer income-generating investments with small growth.

#### Moderate

You are willing and able to accept occasional short-term losses for potential positive returns. You can accept moderate fluctuations in the value of your capital. You want a combination of modest income and growth.

#### Considerable

You are willing and able to accept some investment risk for potentially higher returns. You know that there will be fluctuations in market value. You want to achieve the potential for capital growth and income.

#### High

You are willing and able to accept a significant risk, including the possible loss of principal for the potential to maximise long-term returns. You know that your capital will undergo significant fluctuations. You want maximum growth opportunities for your investment.
