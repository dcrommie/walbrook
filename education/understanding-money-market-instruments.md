## What are Money Market instruments?

Money market instruments are highly liquid, typically short-term, investments.

A portfolio may have a strategic allocation to money market instruments for liquidity and diversification purposes, and they can also serve as a ‘stop-over’ for excess cash between investments. 

### Types of Money Market Instruments

The money market instrument that is most common to retail investors is the Term Deposit.  

An investor lends their money to a financial institution for a specific period of time, usually between one week and a year, in exchange for interest income.

Wholesale and institutional investors, including corporate entities, superannuation and pension funds, typically use a broader range of money market instruments to invest and manage their liquidity and funding needs.

Retail investors may also access these types of money market instruments indirectly, via money market funds or multi-asset funds using money market instruments.

We can split the most common money market instruments by counterparty type:

### Bank Counterparties

* **Term / Call Deposits** - where the investor invests directly with the bank as their counterparty
* **Fiduciary Deposits** - where the bank invests the funds in the name of the bank with a third-party bank issuer, but on the account and risk of the investor i.e the investor bears the counterparty risk
* **Certificates of Deposit (CDS)** - savings certificate entitling the bearer to receive interest. CDS are issued by approved deposit institutions such as banks or credit unions.  The deposit is securitised by the issuing bank, i.e. the investor can sell it before maturity.

### Non-Bank Counterparties

* **Commercial Paper** - issued by corporate entities, including banks and industrial companies, to fund operations and manage liquidity.  Terms range from 1 week to 9 months, with high denominations.
* **Repurchase Agreements** -  agreement to sell a security, commonly a treasury bill, and to repurchase it afterwards.  The difference between the sale and repurchase price is the return, known as the "repo rate".

  To maintain the value of the collateral in the repurchase agreement, any changes in the value of the security may require the seller to post additional funds in a margin account. 
* **Treasury Bills** - short-term government debt obligations with a maturity of one year or less.

## Key features of Money Market Instruments

### Investment Horizon

Short-term

### Return Expectation

Predominantly capital gain, with dividend distributions as portfolio companies restructure or mature.

### Market Expectation

Suitable for expectations of economic growth over the medium-long term.

### Maximum Gain

Income only.

#### Maximum Loss

There is the possibility of total loss, in the case of the default of the counterparty.

### Profit / Loss

Money market investments (like other instruments, e.g. fixed income) offer interest in return of the loan.

When considering returns on money market instruments, investors consider both nominal and real (inflation adjusted) returns.

Interest rates offered depend on the term, amount and risk of default of the counterparty (typically expressed in a credit rating). 

The investor bears interest rate risk on rollover/reinvestment at maturity, and when investing for longer periods the real value of the investment may be eroded by inflation.

Interest income is calculated by using specific day count conventions, i.e. the number of days in a month/year. Daycount conventions have developed historically as a result of the need for easy calculation and time-period constancy. A number of different conventions exist, such as 30/360 method(counting 30 days for each month, and 360 days for the full year) or actual/actual method or actual/360 method.

### Trading Process

Trades in money market instruments are executed over the counter (OTC) i.e. directly between the lender and the borrower, or at an exchange if the product is standardised as is the case with Treasury bills.

### Trading Costs

Investing in money market instruments creates a small amount of explicit and implicit costs for the investor. For example, a bank may charge nothing for their own term deposit product, or 0.50% pa for a fiduciary deposit.

Implicit fees may not be as apparent, as costs are built into the interest rate offered.

## Advantages & Disadvantages

### Advantages

* *Returns are not typically closely correlated with traditional asset classes, providing a diversification benefit to portfolios*
* *May allow for participation in markets that are difficult to access via traditional financial instruments.*

  Higher returns than a savings account

  Liquidity – depending on the time frame chosen,
  money can be withdrawn quickly.

  Less volatile than alternative short-term
  investments.

  Low default risk (depending on the counterparty even guaranteed investments).

  Access to short-term interest rates

  Low fees and taxes

### Disadvantages

* *Typically no secondary market, and where a secondary market exists there is low liquidity and wide spreads*
* *Investment in a Fund or Fund or Funds may be required before investments or funds have been identified*
* *Capital calls and other cash flows are not determinable before investment is made*

  * Since being regarded as safe investments, interest rates are lower than for other investments. 

    Minimum investment volumes apply: usually CHF 250,000 for call deposits, and CHF 100,000 for time deposits.
    Less returns compared to riskier/more volatile short-term investment instruments.
    Interest rate risk on roll-over
    Inflation risk: as rates are usually low the return can
    be diminished by inflation.
    Account minimums usually apply
    Credit risk: risk of the bank holding the deposit
    becoming insolvent.

## Risks

Money market instruments are regarded as being some of the safer investments. 

However, as with any investment certain risks remain.

#### Inflation Risk

there is the risk that inflation will eat up a substantial amount of the return. When investing for a
extended period (by rolling over the investment), inflation can erode the purchasing power of the investment.

#### Currency Risk

When investing into currencies other than the home currency, a corresponding currency risk arises.  If the deposit is done in any currency other than the home currency, a currency risk applies.

**Interest Rate Risk**

Interest rates are usually low compared to other investments – besides the risk of not being able to reinvest at the same rate on roll-over,

**Issuer Risk**

Money market investments are essentially debt obligations. Thus the creditworthiness of the issuer has to be considered when investing.

#### Counterparty Risks and Ratings

There is a minimum risk on the capital invested – the default (credit) risk of the custody bank becoming insolvent.

Money market investments aim at short-term investments with a lower risk and thus are only made with trustworthy counterparties.

• All instruments described above have different counterparties.

• The credit quality of a counterparty for short-term debts is rated by an independent agency such as Moody’s

• Short-term ratings differ from long-term ratings for the bond market (see Understanding Fixed Income).

#### Liquidity Risk

Money market investment may be less liquid than other investments.

Money market instruments are short-term investments – however, being debt obligations they may be less liquid than other instrument categories.

The risk that an investor cannot sell an investment at a fair price within an expected timeframe is called Liquidity Risk.

Listing on a stock exchange does not negate liquidity risk, as there still needs to be a willing buyer. It is common for the shares of small or micro companies ('small caps' and 'micro caps') to present liquidity risks, given there are few shares in issuance and trading volumes are low. Listed investment companies and investment trusts, especially listed private equity vehicles, may also present a liquidity risk.

Liquidity risk is even more prevalent in unlisted assets, including structured products and alternative investments such as private equity or real estate, where no secondary market exists, and the underlying assets are themselves illiquid.

#### Manager Risk

Manager Risk is the risk that an investment manager or investment management team fail to meet their investment objectives or drifts from their stated investment mandate or style.

#### **Market Risk**

The investor is exposed to the general economic environment, e.g. interest rate changes, exchange rates (when not denominated in home currency). The psychology of the market participants tends to enforce trends, and in a market of expectations, not all expectations may be rational.

Private equity funds aim at absolute returns independently of the market environment.  However, some dependencies remain: the economic success of a company also depends on the general economic environment. When the fund exits one of its investments, it may necessitate waiting for favourable conditions on the public market, thus influencing the cash flow to the investors.

#### **Company Risk**

Company risk stems from the economic situation or environment specific to the company, including the quality of the company, its management and its competitors.

Company risk is an unsystematic risk, meaning that an investor can reduce its impact on a portfolio basis by including exposure to other companies, sectors and countries in your portfolio.

#### Legal and Regulatory Risks

Participation in offshore investment vehicles may be restricted by local legislation, and may also influence the taxation of Private Equity investments.
