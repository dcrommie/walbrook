## What is Multi-Generational Home Loan?

A multi-generational home loan allows family members from different generations to pool their financial resources and apply for a home loan together.  

This approach can help families secure homeownership even when one member does not meet traditional lending requirements alone. It is particularly useful for families where income sources vary, or deposit constraints exist. 

### Case Study 

Rebecca was in her late twenties when divorce led her and her young son Oliver to move in with Rebecca’s mother.  

Once the divorce settlement was finalised, Rebecca decided to buy a house where she, her mother, Denise, and her son Oliver could live. Determined to turn a bad situation into a good investment, Rebecca used the divorce settlement for a deposit on a new home. 

Although Rebecca’s mum was in her early sixties, her stable income meant she could manage repayments, and Rebecca would continue to work part-time while Oliver was young. When he gets older, Rebecca expects to work full-time, taking over the repayments as Denise prepares for retirement and has more time to care for her grandson. 

Care should be taken to consider the borrowing capacity and tax implications should one of the owners move out of the home.
