# Understanding Superanuation

We are committed to providing you with investment advice tailored to your needs, requirements, objectives, and degree of investment experience. Whatever the extent of your prior experience of financial products and markets, we strongly recommend you familiarise yourself with the explanatory material provided in this document.

**What is Superannuation?**

Superannuation is an investment vehicle designed to assist Australians save for retirement. The federal government encourages saving through superannuation by providing generous tax incentives for contributions, during investment, and in retirement.

**Contributing to Superannuation**

You can contribute to superannuation in the following circumstances:

* If you are under age 65 you may contribute to superannuation on your own behalf.
* If your spouse is under 65 years of age you may contribute to superannuation on behalf of your spouse.
* If you are 65-69 years of age you may contribute to superannuation if you have worked for at least 40 hours in 30 consecutive days in the current financial year. Your spouse may contribute on your behalf if you meet these criteria.
* If you are 70-74 years of age, you may contribute to superannuation if you have worked for at least 40 hours in 30 consecutive days in the current financial year. Your spouse may not contribute on your behalf.
* If you are under 75 your employer may also be required to or may choose to contribute to superannuation on your behalf.
* If you are over age 75 you are no longer eligible to contribute in to superannuation, regardless of your working status. The cut off date for contributions is the 28th day of the month following your 75th birthday. However , employer contributions may be accepted in limited circumstances.

For more information, refer to the Understanding Superannuation Contributions page.

#### Preservation

While superannuation is extremely important in your overall retirement planning, you must remember government legislation preserves superannuation and restrict your excess to superannuation (including non-concessional contributions) until you meet one of the conditions of release. These conditions include:

* Age 65
* Retirement from the workforce after reaching preservation age
* Transition to retirement after reaching preservative age
* Ceasing an employment arrangement after age 60
* Death
* Total and permanent disablement
* Terminal medical condition
* Permanent departure from Australia for eligible temporary residents
* Severe financial hardship
* Compassionate grounds.

Preservation is designed to ensure that superannuation benefits are used only for retirement.

Preservation ages are based on your date of birth, as follows:

| Date of Birth               | Preservation Age |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Before 1 July 1960          | 55               |
| 1 July 1960 to 30 June 1961 | 56               |
| 1 July 1961 to 30 June 1962 | 57               |
| 1 July 1962 to 30 June 1963 | 58               |
| 1 July 1963 to 30 June 1964 | 59               |
| After 30 June 1964          | 60               |

### Accessing your Superannuation Benefits

Once you have met a condition of release, you may retain your funds in superannuation, withdraw them from the superannuation environment, or commence a retirement income stream. The tax and social security implications of these options differ significantly.

#### Accessing your superannuation as an income stream

The main type of superannuation income stream is an account-based pension. Account-based pensions provide a flexible and tax-effective method of generating income in retirement.

Earnings and capital gains within the account-based pension are tax free. pension payments may be taxable when you receive them (unless the recipient is at least 60 years of age) however, subject to individual circumstances, if you are under age 60, you may be eligible to claim a tax-free amount, as well as a 15% tax rebate on the taxable portion of the payment.

“Transition to retirement” is a government initiative aimed at encouraging people to participate in the workforce longer by offering incentives to older workers.

Under this scheme it is possible for you to reach your superannuation preservation age and access benefits in the form of a non-commutable income stream before you permanently retire.

For further information on transition to retirement income stream, see “Understanding account-based pensions” or speak with your financial adviser.

### Accessing your superannuation as a lump sum

The tax-free component of a superannuation benefit is generally made up of your non-concessional contributions. The taxable component of a superannuation benefit is the total value of the superannuation benefit less the tax-free component. The taxable component is generally made up of your concessional contributions as well as earnings.

When you withdraw your funds, the following taxation implications will apply for 2016/17

|                    |                        |                            |                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- |
| Component          | Below Preservation Age | Preservation Age to Age 59 | Age 60 and over |
| Tax-Free Component | Tax free               | Tax free                   | Tax free        |
| Taxable Component  | 20% plus Medicare      | First $205,000 T           |                 |



### Insurance within Superannuation

Many superannuation funds provide you with the range of personal insurance options designed to protect you in the event of serious injury, if you can no longer work or if you die. One of the key benefits of buying insurance through your superannuation fund is that it's usually much cheaper than if you organised it on your own.

Most financial experts agree that insurances such as income protection, life insurance, trauma cover and total and permanent disability (TPD) are fundamental to any good financial plan. Note that Trauma is generally not offered by superannuation funds.

| **Insurance**                       | **Purpose**                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Life                                | Pays your beneficiaries a lump sum when you die                                                |
| Total & Permanent Disablement (TPD) | Pays you a lump sum if you are unlikely to work again due to a total and permanent disability. |
| Trauma                              | Pays you a lump sum if you suffer a specified serious illness.                                 |
| Income Protection                   | Replaces part of your income if you are sick or injured and can't work.                        |



Speak to your financial adviser about whether you should hold insurance inside or outside superannuation.

### Superannuation Death Benefits

The tax payable on death benefits depends on your age when you die, and/or whether your beneficiary is a dependant (as defined under tax legislation).

A tax dependant is a current or former spouse, child under 18, financial dependant or someone who was in an interdependency relationship with you prior to your death.
