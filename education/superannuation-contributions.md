**What is Superannuation?**

Superannuation is an investment vehicle designed to assist Australians save for retirement. The federal government encourages saving through superannuation by providing generous tax incentives for contributions, during investment, and in retirement.

**Contributing to Superannuation**

You can contribute to superannuation in the following circumstances:

* If you are under age 65 you may contribute to superannuation on your own behalf.
* If your spouse is under 65 years of age you may contribute to superannuation on behalf of your spouse.
* If you are 65-69 years of age you may contribute to superannuation if you have worked for at least 40 hours in 30 consecutive days in the current financial year. Your spouse may contribute on your behalf if you meet these criteria.
* If you are 70-74 years of age, you may contribute to superannuation if you have worked for at least 40 hours in 30 consecutive days in the current financial year. Your spouse may not contribute on your behalf.
* If you are under 75 your employer may also be required to or may choose to contribute to superannuation on your behalf.
* If you are over age 75 you are no longer eligible to contribute in to superannuation, regardless of your working status. The cut off date for contributions is the 28th day of the month following your 75th birthday. However , employer contributions may be accepted in limited circumstances.

## Types of Contributions

Superannuation contributions can be split into the following types

<insert table of different contribution types>

[Concessional contributions](<>)

Concessional contributions are tax deductible superannuation contributions and include:

* Contributions made by an employer on behalf of employees
* Salary sacrifice contributions
* Contributions made by eligible persons including self employed and those with no employment income (eg. retirees, those earning passive income)

Tax deductible contributions can only be made to superannuation funds which comply with government regulations.

If eligible, concessional contributions are generally used to reduce income tax payable or to offset a capital gains tax liability.

Generally concessional contributions are subject to 15%1 contributions tax payable by the superannuation fund. Contributions tax paid by low income earners may be offset by the low income superannuation rebate.

The government limits the amount of concessional contributions which can be made for individuals by an employer, or by an eligible person for themselves, in any one financial year without penalty. The limit from the 2017/2018 financial year is $25,000 per annum for all members.

[Employer superannuation contributions](<>)

Employers are required to make superannuation contributions on behalf of their employees under the superannuation guarantee (SG) scheme. They may also offer employees the opportunity to sacrifice a portion of their pre-tax income in exchange for increased concessional superannuation contributions. This is known as “salary sacrifice”. There is no restriction to the amount of concessional contributions allowed to be contributed to superannuation; however, contributions over the annual cap will be refunded and taxed at a marginal tax rates plus Medicare. A penalty interest charge is also apply. Additionally any excess will count towards the non-concessional contributions limit (explained further on).

[Superannuation guarantee](<>)

The SG system was introduced during the early 1990s. The SG payable by all employers (as at 1 July 2019) is 9.5% of their employees earnings and must be paid quarterly. Employers are required to contribute only up to a maximum of $20,531 annum for the 2018/19 financial year (9.5%2 of $216,120 known as the maximum contribution base). In addition, an employer is not required to make superannuation contributions for employee who earns less than $450 per month. Superannuation contributions can be paid above these amounts. However, the employer is not legally obliged to do so.

It is important to note that SG contributions count towards the concessional contribution limit.

The SG rate will progressively increase to 12% by 2025/26.

[Salary sacrifice](<>)

Salary sacrifice is the portion of pre-tax salary that an employee gives up in exchange for additional contributions being made to superannuation for the employee by the employer.

Salary sacrificed superannuation contributions are taxed at 15%3 on entry to the fund. This is generally a much lower rate than the individual's marginal tax rate. Through salary sacrifice you can therefore reduce your tax liability while building wealth for your retirement.

It is important to note that salary sacrifice contributions count towards the concessional contribution limit.

contributions tax of 30% applies to individuals earning income greater than $250,000.

[Concessional contributions](<>)

The government offers generous tax concessions to encourage you to save for your own retirement. Self-employer persons generally do not receive employer contributions under the superannuation guarantee scheme and are not required to make superannuation contributions on their own behalf.

To determine your eligibility to make a concessional contribution, consult with your financial adviser or tax professional. Eligible persons are able to make concessional contributions and to claim a deduction for these contributions up to age 75. Withdrawals/rollovers will impact the maximum amount of contributions that can be claimed as a tax deduction.

[Non-concessional contributions](<>)

Non-concessional contributions are personal contributions to your superannuation that you do not claim a tax deduction for. These contributions can attract benefits such as:

* Government co-contributions,
* Spouse contributions tax offset, and/or
* Tax concessions in retirement.

For the 2017/18 financial year, the maximum non-concessional contributions you can make without penalty is $100,000. For those under age 65, the bring forward provision allows total contributions of $300,000 over three years.

##### Example - one off after-tax contributions

Investors A and B are both 25 years old and each has a superannuation balance of $10,000 and salary of $45,000. Concerned that she might not have enough money for her retirement, investor A decides to make a non-concessional contribution of $5,000 to her superannuation fund. Investor B does not.

Over 40 years, Investor A's superannuation balance would be $532,355\* compared to investor B's balance of $510,186\* that's a difference off $22,169 over the period based on just one additional contribution.

\*Figures based on gross annual returns of 7.20p.a reinvested. No allowances have been made for fees, expenses or negative investment returns. Both investors retire at age 65. Results are expressed in current dollars.

Government co-contributions

If you make a non-concessional superannuation contribution of $1,000, the government may contribute up to $500 (2017/18) in to your superannuation account. You are eligible to receive the government co-contribution providing you:

* Have assessable income, reportable fringe benefit and reportable employer superannuation contributions (RESC) in the income year less than the upper income threshold (i.e $51,813 for 2018/19)
* Have a made a personal superannuation contribution
* Have earned at least 10% of your assessable income, reportable fringe benefits and RESC from employment or business income
* Are not the holder of an eligible temporary resident visa
* Are less than 71 years old at the end of the income year and
* Have lodged a tax return.

The government co-contribution is available to you if you are self employed providing you earn 10% or more of your income from carrying on a business, eligible employment, or a combination of both.

Once eligible, the income test determines the amount of co-contribution you may receive. If your earnings (assessable income, reportable fringe benefits and reportable employer superannuation contributions) are less than $51,813 in the year you make a personal contribution, the government will contribute 50 cents for every $1 you contribute up to a maximum of $500. For earnings between $36,813 and $51,813, the $500 maximum is reduced by 0.03333 cents for every dollar earned over $36,813 until it cuts out altogether at $51,813. This means that for every $1 of personal contributions, the government will contribute up to 50 cents, up to the maximum contribution amount available for your income level. These figures are relevant for the 2018/19 financial year.

Government co-contributions are not tax-deductible and are not taxed when the superannuation fund receives them. You do not need to apply for the government co-contribution. The ATO automatically calculates whether you are entitled to it, using information from your superannuation fund and your tax return. The government co-contribution is paid as a non-concessional contribution and it is paid directly in to the same superannuation fund to which you made your personal contribution. However, the government co-contribution does not count towards the non-concessional contribution limit.

[Spouse contributio](<>)n

A superannuation member may make non-concessional contributions in to superannuation on behalf of his/her spouse as long as the spouse is under age 70. From the ages of 65 - 70 the receiving spouse must work at least 40 hours in 30 consecutive days in the financial year of contribution. The non-concessional contribution limit applies to the receiving spouse.

Once spouse contributions are put in to superannuation, they are “preserved”. This means they can't be withdrawn until the receiving spouse meets a condition of release (eg. Turning 65 or retiring between 55 and 65).

If you make a contribution to superannuation on behalf of your low income earning spouse, you may be eligible for a tax offset within certain limits. ‘Low income earning' for purposes of the offset is where your spouse has assessable income, reportable fringe benefits and reportable employer superannuation contributions (RESC) of less than $40,000 per annum.

A spouse is defined as either a legal or a de facto husband or wife, although they need to be living together for the contributing spouse to claim the rebate.

The maximum rebate is 18% of the eligible spouse contributions, up to a maximum of $3,000 in contributions (i.e. the maximum rebate is $540). The maximum rebate applies where the recipient spouse has a total income of less than $40,000 per annum.

Further conditions for the rebate to apply are that both partners must be Australian residents at that time of contribution and the contributing spouse may not claim the contributions as a tax deduction.

Spouse contributions are treated as non-concessional contributions and are preserved.

### [Understanding Excess Superannuation Contributions](<>)

Extra superannuation contributions are not always welcome as breaching contribution limits can result in substantial penalties.

[Why are there limits on how much I can contribute to Superannuation ?](<>)

Regular contributions enable you to grow your superannuation faster by way of compounding your investment returns.

While the government wants to encourage people to save for retirement, it doesn't want us treating superannuation as a tax haven . For this reason limits have been placed on both concessional (before tax) and non-concessional (after tax) contributions.

##### [](<>)There is no restriction to the amount of concessional contributions allowed to be contributed to superannuation; however, contributions over the annual cap will be refunded and taxed at a marginal tax rates plus Medicare. A penalty interest charge is also apply. Additionally any excess will count towards the non-concessional contributions limit (explained further on).

All superannuation investors are subject to a Concessional contributions limit of $25,000 per year from July 1st 2017. Prior to this, the limit is dependent upon your age.

Non-concessional contributions limit is $100,000 per year, effective from July 1st, 2017 (or up to $300,000 in any prospective three period under the ‘bring forward' rule) for members under 65.

[What happens if I exceed these limits?](<>)

Excess Concessional contributions are taxed at 31.5% (In addition to ordinary 15% contributions tax) with the amount of your excess contributions also counting towards the Non-concessional limit. Excess Non-concessional contributions are taxed at 46.5%.

Exceeding the contribution limits is not uncommon, particularly as many people don't realise that their employer superannuation guarantee contributions count towards Concessional contributions limits.

[What do I do if I am unsure of my contribution amounts?](<>)

Given the potential consequences of breaching the contribution limits, it is important to speak to your financial adviser if you are unsure about your contributions amounts.

[How do I find out more?](<>)

Talk to your financial adviser to learn more about how to maximise your superannuation contributions and stay within the limits of the contribution limits.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

Stock prices are influenced not only by the individual company’s economic success but also by large-scale economic trends.

Depending on the stocks and legislation, shares can include the right to purchase additional stocks when the company raises its capital basis. The price of this right is usually included in the stock price. Rights can also be traded as an individual product; the use of such products requires a basic knowledge of derivatives and the risks involved.

Advantages

* Superannuation fund earnings are taxed at a maximum rate of 15% (10% for crystallised capital gains on assets held for at least 12 months). Additionally income tax of 15% may be offset by imputation credits derived from Australian equity-based investments within the fund. You can also reduce the tax payable by paying insurance premiums from superannuation money.
* You may be able to claim a tax deduction for contributions, a tax offset or co-contribution.
* There are no personal income tax implications from the returns earned by superannuation funds as no income is distributed.
* By rolling over superannuation funds rather than cashing out, the payment of lump sum tax can be deferred and possibly eliminated.
* If you are age 60 or over, you can withdraw from superannuation, either as income or lump sum tax free.
* If you are under age 60, you can receive income from a superannuation retirement income stream and receive concessional tax treatment possibly including a tax-free amount and a 15% tax offset on the taxable income.
* Superannuation in the accumulation phase does not count under the Centrelink assets test or income test for persons under age pension age.
